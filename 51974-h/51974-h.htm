    <h2>
      CHAPTER I&mdash;FELLOW VOYAGERS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>N a night in
      October, 1911, the river steamer <i>Yen Hsin</i> lay alongside the godown,
      or warehouse, of the Chinese Navigation Company at Shanghai. Her black
      hull bulked large in the darkness that was spotted with inadequate
      electric lights. Her white cabins, above, lighted here and there, loomed
      high and ghostly, extending as far as the eye could easily see from the
      narrow wharf beneath. Swarming continuously across the gangplanks,
      chanting rhythmically to keep the quick shuffling step, crews of coolies
      carried heavy boxes and bales swung from bamboo poles.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the evening the white passengers were coming aboard by ones and
      twos and finding their cabins, all of which were forward on the promenade
      deck, grouped about the enclosed area that was to be at once their
      dining-room and &ldquo;social hall.&rdquo; Here, within a narrow space, bounded by
      strips of outer deck and a partition wall, these few casual passengers
      were to be caught, willy-nilly, in a sort of passing comradeship. For the
      greater part of this deck, amidships and aft, was screened off for the use
      of traveling Chinese officials, and the two lower decks would be crowded
      with lower class natives and freight. And, not unnaturally, in the minds
      of nearly all the white folk, as they settled for the night, arose
      questions as to the others aboard. For strange beings of many nations dig
      a footing of sorts on the China Coast, and odd contrasts occur when any
      few are thrown together by a careless fate.... And so, thinking variously
      in their separate cabins of the meeting to come, at breakfast about the
      single long table, and of the days of voyaging into the heart of oldest
      China, these passengers, one by one, fell asleep; while through open
      shutters floated quaint odors and sounds from the tangle of sampans and
      slipper-boats that always line the curving bund and occasional shouts and
      songs from late revelers passing along the boulevard beyond the rows of
      trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was well after midnight when the <i>Yen Hsin</i> drew in her lines and
      swung off into the narrow channel of the Whangpoo. Drifting sampans,
      without lights, scurried out of her path. With an American captain on the
      strip of promenade deck, forward, that served for a bridge, a yellow
      pilot, and Scotch engineers below decks, she slipped down with the tide,
      past the roofed-over opium hulks that were anchored out there, past the
      dimly outlined stone buildings of the British and American quarter, on
      into the broader Wusung. Here a great German mail liner lay at anchor,
      lighted from stem to stem. Farther down lay three American cruisers; and
      below these a junk, drifting dimly by with ribbed sails flapping and
      without the sign of a light, built high astern, like the ghost of a
      medieval trader.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's his lights now!&rdquo; Thus the captain to a huge figure of a man who
      stood, stooping a little, beside him, peering out at the river. And the
      captain, a stocky little man with hands in the pockets of a heavy jacket,
      added&mdash;&ldquo;The dirty devil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, a small green light showed now on the junk's quarter; and then she
      was gone astern.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a silence, the captain said: &ldquo;You may as well turn in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I will,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;Though I get a good deal more sleep
      than I need on the river. And very little exercise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the devil of this life, of course. Look a' me&mdash;I'm fat!&rdquo; The
      captain spoke in a rough, faintly blustering tone, perhaps in a nervous
      response to the well-modulated voice of his mate, &ldquo;Must make even more
      difference to you&mdash;the way you've lived. And at that, after all, you
      ain't a slave to the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.... in a sense, I'm not.&rdquo; The mate fell silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were, of course, vast differences in the degrees of misfortune among
      the flotsam and jetsam of the coast. Captain Benjamin, now, had a native
      wife and five or six half-caste children tucked away somewhere in the
      Chinese city of Shanghai.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've gut quite a bunch aboard this trip,&rdquo; offered the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One or two well-known people. There's our American millionaire, Dawley
      Kane. Took four outside cabins. His son's with him, and a secretary, and a
      Japanese that's been up with him before. Wonder if it's a pleasure trip&mdash;or
      if it means that the Kane interests are getting hold up the river. It
      might, at that. They bought the Cantey line, you know, in nineteen eight.
      Then there's Tex Connor, and his old sidekick the Manila Kid, and a couple
      of women schoolteachers from home, and six or eight others&mdash;customs
      men and casuals. And Dixie Carmichael&mdash;she's aboard. Quite a bunch!
      And His Nibs gets on tomorrow at Nanking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kang, you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same. There's a story that he's ordered up to Peking. They were
      talking about it yesterday at the office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he's in trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't say. But if you ask me, it don't look like such a good time to be
      easy on these agitators, now does it? And they tell me he's been letting
      'em off, right and left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mate stood musing, holding to the rail. &ldquo;It's a problem,&rdquo; he replied,
      after a little, rather absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The funny thing is&mdash;he ain't going on through. Not this trip,
      anyhow. We're ordered to put him off at his old place, this side of Huang
      Chau. Have to use the boats. You might give them a look-see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They've gossiped about Kang before this at Shanghai.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shanghai,&rdquo; cried the captain, with nervous irrelevancy, &ldquo;is full of
      information about China&mdash;and it's all wrong!&rdquo; He added then, &ldquo;Seen
      young Black lately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mate moved his head in the negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consul-general sent him down from Hankow, after old Chang stopped that
      native paper of his. I ran into him yesterday, over to the bank. He says
      the revolution's going to break before summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mate made no reply to this. Every trip the captain talked in this
      manner. His one deep fear was that the outbreak might take place while he
      was far up the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been supposed by all experienced observers of the Chinese scene,
      that the Manchu Dynasty would not long survive the famous old empress
      dowager, the vigorous and imperious little woman who was known throughout
      a rational and tolerant empire, not without a degree of affection, as &ldquo;the
      Old Buddha.&rdquo; She had at the time of the present narrative been dead two
      years and more; the daily life of the infant emperor was in the control of
      a new empress dowager, that Lung Yu who was notoriously overriding the
      regent and dictating such policies of government as she chose in the
      intervals between protracted periods of palace revelry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one really powerful personage in Peking that year was the chief
      eunuch, Chang Yuan-fu, a former actor, notoriously the empress's personal
      favorite, who catered to her pleasures, robbed the imperial treasury of
      vast sums, wreaked ugly vengeance on critical censors, and publicly
      insulted dukes of the royal house.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was familiar. The Manchu strain had dwindled out; and while an
      empress pleased her jaded appetites by having an actor cut with the lash
      in her presence for an indifferent performance, all South China, from
      Canton to the Yangtze, seethed with the steadily increasing ferment of
      revolution. Conspirators ranged the river and the coast. At secret
      meetings in Singapore, Tokio, San Francisco and New York, new and bloody
      history was planned. The oldest and hugest of empires was like a vast
      crater that steamed and bubbled faintly here and there as hot vital forces
      accumulated beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mate, pondering the incalculable problem, finally spoke: &ldquo;I suppose,
      if this revolt should bring serious trouble to Kang, it might affect you
      and me as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain flared up, the blustering note rising higher in his voice.
      &ldquo;But somebody'll have to run the boats, won't they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they run at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His impersonal tone seemed to irritate further the captain's troubled
      spirit. &ldquo;If they run at all, eh? It's all right for you&mdash;you can go
      it alone&mdash;you haven't got children on your mind, young ones!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The big man was silent again. A great hand gripped a stanchion tightly as
      he gazed out at the dark expanse of water. The captain, glancing around at
      him, looking a second time at that hand, turned away, with a little sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will say good night,&rdquo; remarked the mate abruptly, and left his chief to
      his uncertain thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steamer moved deliberately out into the wide estuary of the Yangtze,
      which is at this point like a sea. Squatting at the edge of the deck,
      outside the rail, the pilot spoke musically to the Chinese quartermaster.
      Slowly, a little at a time, as she plowed the ruffling water, the steamer
      swung off to the northwest to begin her long journey up the mighty river
      to Hankow where the passengers would change for the smaller Ichang
      steamer, or for the express to Peking over the still novel trunk railway.
      And if, as happened not infrequently, the <i>Yen Hsin</i> should break
      down or stick in the mud, the Peking passengers would wait a week about
      the round stove in the old Astor House at Hankow for the next express.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mighty river indeed, is the Yangtze. During half the year battle-ships
      of reasonably deep draught may reach Hankow. In the heyday of the sailing
      trade clippers out of New York and blunt lime-juicers out of Liverpool
      were any day sights from the bund there. Through a busy and not seldom
      bloody century the merchants of a clamorous outside world have roved the
      great river (where yellow merchants of the Middle Kingdom, in sampan,
      barge and junk, roved fifty centuries before them) with rich cargoes of
      tea (in leaden chests that bore historic ideographs on the enclosing
      matting)&mdash;with hides and horns and coal from Hupeh and furs and musk
      from far-away Szechuen, with soya beans and rice and bristles and nutgalls
      and spices and sesamum, with varnish and tung oil and vegetable tallow,
      with cotton, ramie, rape and hemp, with copper, quicksilver, slate, lead
      and antimony, with porcelains and silk. Along this river that to-day
      divides an empire into two vast and populous domains a thousand thousand
      fortunes have been gained and lost, rebellions and wars have raged,
      famines have blighted whole peoples. Forts, pagodas and palaces have lined
      its banks. The gilded barges of emperors have drifted idly on its broad
      bosom. Exquisite painted beauties have found mirrors in its neighboring
      canals. Its waters drain to-day the dusty red plain where Lady Ch'en, the
      Helen, of China, rocked a throne and died.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning sun rode high. Soft-footed cabin stewards in blue robes
      removed the long red tablecloth and laid a white. By ones and twos the
      passengers appeared from their cabins or from the breezy deck and took
      their seats, eying one another with guarded curiosity as they bowed a
      morning greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Andrews, of Indianapolis, stepped out from her cabin through a narrow
      corridor, and then, at sight of the table, stopped short, while her color
      rose slightly. Miss Andrews was slender, a year or so under thirty, and,
      in a colorless way, pretty. Shy and sensitive, the scene before her was
      one her mind's eye had failed to picture; the seats about the long table
      were half filled, and entirely with men. She saw, in that one quick look,
      the face of a young German between those of two Englishmen. A remarkably
      thin man in a check suit looked up and for an instant fixed furtive eyes
      on hers. Just beyond him sat a big man, with a round wooden face and one
      glass eye; he turned his head with his eyes to look at her. A quiet man of
      fifty-odd, with gray hair, a nearly white mustache that was cropped close,
      and the expression of quiet satisfaction that only wealth and settled
      authority can give, was putting a spoonful of condensed milk into his
      coffee. Next to him sat a young man&mdash;very young, certainly not much
      more than twenty or twenty-one&mdash;perhaps his son (the aquiline nose
      and slightly receding but wide and full forehead were the same)&mdash;rubbing
      out a cigarette on his butter plate. He had been smoking before breakfast.
      She remembered these two now; they had been at the Astor House in
      Shanghai; they were the Kanes, of New York, the famous Kanes. They called
      the son, &ldquo;Rocky&rdquo;&mdash;Rocky Kane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unable to take in more, Miss Andrews stepped back a little way into the
      corridor, deciding to wait for her traveling companion, Miss Means, of
      South Bend. She could hardly go out there alone and sit down with all
      those men.
    </p>
    <p>
      But just then a door opened and closed; and across the way, coming
      directly, easily, out into the diningroom, Miss Andrews beheld the
      surprising figure of a slim girl&mdash;or a girl she appeared at first
      glance&mdash;of nineteen or twenty, wearing a blue, middy blouse and short
      blue shirt. Her black hair was drawn loosely together at the neck and tied
      with a bow of black ribbon. Her somewhat pale face, with its thin line of
      a mouth, straight nose, curving black eyebrows and oddly pale eyes, was in
      some measure attractive. She took her seat at the table without
      hesitation, acknowledging the reserved greetings of various of the men
      with a slight inclination of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Miss Andrews that she might now go on in there. But the
      thought that some of these men had surely noticed her confusion was
      disconcerting; and so it was a relief to hear Miss Means pattering on
      behind her. For that firmly thin little woman had fought life to a
      standstill and now, except in the moments of prim severity that came
      unaccountably into possession of her thoughts, found it dryly amusing.
      They took their seats, these two little ladies, Miss Means laying her copy
      of <i>Things Chinese</i> beside her coffee cup; and Miss Andrews tried to
      bow her casual good mornings as the curious girl in the middy blouse had
      done. The girl, by the way, seemed a very little older at close view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Andrews stole glimpses, too, at young Mr. Rocky Kane. He was a
      handsome boy, with thick chestnut hair from which he had not wholly
      succeeded in brushing the curl, but she was not sure that she liked the
      flush on his cheeks, or the nervous brightness of the eyes, or the
      expression about the mouth. There had been stories floating about the
      hotel in Shanghai. He plainly lacked discipline. But she saw that he might
      easily fascinate a certain sort of woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      A door opened, and in from the deck came an extraordinarily tall man,
      stooping as he entered. On his cap, in gilt, was lettered, &ldquo;1st Mate.&rdquo; He
      took the seat opposite Mr. Kane, senior, next to the head of the table. It
      seemed to Miss Andrews that she had never seen so tall a man; he must have
      stood six feet five or six inches. He was solid, broad of shoulder, a
      magnificent specimen of manhood. And though the hair was thin on top of
      his head, and his grave quiet face exhibited the deep lines of middle age,
      he moved with almost the springy-step of a boy. If others at the table
      were difficult to place on the scale of life, this mate was the most
      difficult of all. With that strong reflective face, and the bearing of one
      who knows only good manners (though he said nothing at all after his first
      courteously spoken, &ldquo;Good morning!&rdquo;) he could not have been other than a
      gentleman&mdash;Miss Andrews felt that&mdash;an American gentleman! Yet
      his position.... mate of a river steamer in China....!
    </p>
    <p>
      The atmosphere about the table was constrained throughout the meal. The
      Chinese stewards padded softly about. The one-eyed man stared around the
      table without the slightest expression on his impassive face. The girl in
      the middy blouse kept her head over her plate. Miss Andrews once caught
      Rocky Kane glancing at her with an expression nearly as furtive as that of
      the thin man in the check suit. It was after this small incident that
      young Kane began helping her to this and that; and, when they rose,
      followed her out to her deck chair and insisted on tucking her up in her
      robe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These fall breezes are pretty sharp on the river,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But say,
      maybe it isn't hot in summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it is,&rdquo; murmured Miss Andrews.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been out here a couple of times with the pater. You'll find the
      river interesting. Oh, not down here&rdquo;&mdash;he indicated the wide expanse
      of muddy water and the low-lying, distant shore&mdash;&ldquo;but beyond
      Chinkiang and Nanking, where it's narrower. Lots of quaint sights. The
      ports are really fascinating. We stop a lot, you know. At Wuhu the water
      beggars come out in tubs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In tubs!&rdquo; breathed Miss Andrews.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Means joined them then, book under arm; and met his offer to tuck her
      up with a crisply pointed, &ldquo;No, thank you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He soon drifted away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said Miss Andrews: &ldquo;Weren't you a little hard on him, Gerty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; replied Miss Means severely&mdash;her Puritan vein strongly
      uppermost&mdash;&ldquo;that young man won't do. Not at all. I saw him myself,
      one night at the Astor House, going into one of those private dining-rooms
      with a woman who&mdash;well, her character, or lack of it, was
      unmistakable!... Right there in the hotel.... under his father's eyes.
      That's what too much money will do to a young man, if you ask me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh....!&rdquo; breathed Miss Andrews, looking out with startled eyes at the
      gulls.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was mid-afternoon when Captain Benjamin remarked to his first mate:
      &ldquo;Tex Connor's got down to work, Mr. Duane. Better try to stop it, if you
      don't mind. They're in young Kane's cabin&mdash;sixteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Number sixteen was the last cabin aft in the port side, next the canvas
      screen that separated upper class white from upper class yellow. The
      wooden shutters had been drawn over the windows and the light turned on
      within. Cigarette smoke drifted thickly out.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were slow to open. Doane heard the not unfamiliar voice of the Manila
      Kid advising against it. He had to knock repeatedly. They were crowded
      together in the narrow space between berth and couch, a board across their
      knees&mdash;Connor twisting his head to fix his one eye on the intruder,
      the Kid, in his check suit, a German of the customs and Rocky Kane. There
      were cards, chips and a heap of money in American and English notes and
      gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; cried Kane. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better stop this,&rdquo; said the mate quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come, we're just having a friendly game! What right have you to break
      into a private room, anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mate, stooping within the doorway, took the boy in with thoughtful
      eyes, but did not reply directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connor, with another look upward, picked up the cards, and with the
      uncanny mental quickness of a practised <i>croupier</i> redistributed the
      heap of money to its original owners, and squeezed out without a word, the
      mate moving aside for him. The German left sulkily. The Kid snapped his
      fingers in disgust, and followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane was moving away when the Kid caught his elbow. He asked: &ldquo;Did
      Benjamin send you around?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane inclined his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Running things with a pretty high hand, you and him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep away from that boy,&rdquo; was the quiet reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thin man looked up at the grave strong face above the massive
      shoulders; hesitated; walked away. The mate was again about to leave when
      young Kane spoke. He was in the doorway now, leaning there, hands in
      pockets, his eyes blazing with indignation and injured pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those men were my guests!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry, Mr. Kane, to disturb your private affairs, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you do it, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The captain will not allow Tex Connor to play cards on this boat. At
      least, not without a fair warning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy's face pictured the confusion in his mind, as he wavered from
      anger through surprise into youthful curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh....&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Oh.... so that's Tex Connor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. And Jim Watson with him. He was cashiered from the army in the
      Philippines. He is generally known now, along the coast, as the Manila
      Kid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that's Tex Connor!.... He managed the North End Sporting in London,
      three years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely. I believe he is known in London and Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a professional gambler, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not undertaking to characterize him. But if you would accept a word
      of advice&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't asked for it, that I'm aware of.&rdquo; An instant after he had said
      this, the boy's face changed. He looked up at the immense frame of the man
      before him, and into the grave face. The warm color came into his own.
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm sorry!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I needn't have said that.&rdquo; But confusion still
      lay behind that immature face. The very presence of this big man affected
      him to a degree wholly out of keeping with the fellow's station in life,
      as he saw it. But he needn't have been rude. &ldquo;Look here, are you going to
      say anything to my father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will the captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have to ask him yourself. Though you could hardly expect to keep
      it from him long, at this rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;he's so busy! He shuts himself up all day with Braker, his
      secretary. The chap with the big spectacles. You see&rdquo;&mdash;Kane laughed
      self-consciously; a naively boyish quality in him, kept him talking more
      eagerly than he knew&mdash;&ldquo;the pater's reached the stage when he feels he
      ought to put himself right before the world. I guess he's been a great old
      pirate, the pater&mdash;you know, wrecking railroads and grabbing banks
      and going into combinations. Though it's just what all the others have
      done. From what I've heard about some of them&mdash;friends of ours, too!&mdash;you
      have to, nowadays, in business. No place for little men or soft men. It's
      a two-fisted game. This fellow spent a couple of years writing the pater's
      autobiography:&mdash;seems funny, doesn't it!&mdash;and they're going over
      it together on this trip. That's why Braker came along; there's no time at
      home. The original plan was to have Braker tutor me. That was when I broke
      out of college. But, lord!....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll excuse me now,&rdquo; said the mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the Manila Kid had sidled up to the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Cap,&rdquo; he observed cautiously, &ldquo;wha'd you come down on Tex like that
      for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come,&rdquo; replied the captain testily, not turning, &ldquo;don't bother me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what you expect us to do all this time on the river&mdash;play
      jackstraws?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care what you do! Some trips they get up deck games.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deck games!&rdquo; The Kid sniffed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll find plenty to read in the library&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read!....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I guess you'll just have to stand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some time they stood side by side without speaking; the captain eying
      the river, the Kid moodily observing water buffalo bathing near the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tex has got that Chinese heavyweight of his aboard&mdash;down below.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;that Tom Sung?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep. Knocked out Bull Kennedy in three rounds at the Shanghai Sporting.
      Got some matches for him up at Peking and Tientsin. Taking him over to
      Japan after that. There's an American marine that's cleaned up three
      ships'.&rdquo; He was silent for a space; then added: &ldquo;I suppose, now, if we was
      to arrange a little boxing entertainment, you wouldn't stand for that
      either, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's all right. Take the social hall if the ladies don't object.
      But who would you put up against him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;if we could find a young fellow on board, Tex could tell Tom
      to go light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might ask Mr. Doane. He complains he ain't getting exercise enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's pretty old&mdash;still, I'd hate to go up against him myself....
      Say, you ask him, Cap!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll think it over. He's a little.... I'll tell you now he wouldn't stand
      for your making a show of it. If he did it, it 'ud just be for exercise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's all right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Means awoke with a start. It was the second morning out, at sunrise.
      The engines were still, but from without an extraordinary hubbub rent the
      air. Drums were beating, reed instruments wailing in weird dissonance, and
      innumerable voices chattering and shouting. A sudden crackling suggested
      fire-crackers in quantity. Miss means raised herself on one elbow, and saw
      her roommate peeping out over the blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks very much like the real China we've read about,&rdquo; replied Miss
      Andrews, raising her voice above the din. &ldquo;It's certainly very different
      from Shanghai.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The steamer lay alongside a landing hulk at the foot of broad steps.
      Warehouses crowded the bank and the bund above, some of Western
      construction; but the crowded scene on hulk and steps and bund, and among
      the matting-roofed sampans, hundreds of which were crowded against the
      bank, was wholly Oriental. From every convenient mast and pole pennants
      and banners spread their dragons on the fresh early breeze. A temporary <i>pen-low</i>,
      or archway, at the top of the steps was gay with fresh paint and
      streamers. In the air above were scores of kites, designed and painted to
      represent dragons and birds of prey, which the owners were maneuvering in
      mimic aerial warfare; swooping and darting and diving. As Miss Means
      looked, one huge painted bird fell in shreds to a neighboring roof, and
      the swarming assemblage cheered ecstatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soldiers were marching in good-humored disorder down the bund, in the
      inevitable faded blue with blue turbans wound about their heads. It
      appeared as if not another person could force his way down on the hulk
      without crowding at least one of its occupants into the water, yet on they
      came; and so far as our two little ladies could see none fell. Fully two
      hundred of the soldiers there were, with short rifles and bayonets. Amid
      great confusion they formed a lane down the steps and across to the
      gangway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next came a large, bright-colored sedan chair slung on cross-poles, with
      eight bearers and with groups of silk-clad mandarins walking before and
      behind. Farther back, swaying along, were eight or ten more chairs, each
      with but four bearers and each tightly closed, waiting in line as the
      chair of the great one was set carefully down on the hulk and opened by
      the attending officials.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deliberately, smilingly, the great one stepped out. He was a man of
      seventy or older, with a drooping gray mustache and narrow chin beard of
      gray that contrasted oddly with the black queue. His robe was black with a
      square bit of embroidery in rich color on the breast. Above his hat of
      office a huge round ruby stood high on a gold mount, and a peacock feather
      slanted down behind it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bowing to right and left, he ascended the gangplank, the mandarins
      following. There were fifteen of these, each with a round button on his
      plumed hat&mdash;those in the van of red coral, the others of sapphire and
      lapis lazuli, rock crystal, white stone and gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      One by one the lesser chairs were brought out on the hulk and opened. From
      the first stepped a stout woman of mature years, richly clad in heavily
      embroidered silks, with loops of pearls about her neck and shoulders, and
      with painted face under the elaborately built-up head-dress. Other women
      of various' ages followed, less conspicuously clad. From the last chair
      appeared a young woman, slim and graceful even in enveloping silks, her
      face, like the others, a mask of white paint and rouge, with lips carmined
      into a perfect cupid's bow. And with her, clutching her hand, was a little
      girl of six or seven, who laughed merrily upward at the great steamer as
      she trotted along.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blue-clad servants followed, a hundred or more, and swarming cackling
      women with unpainted faces and flapping black trousers, and porters&mdash;long
      lines of porters&mdash;with boxes and bales and bundles swung from the
      inevitable bamboo poles.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they were all aboard, and the steamer moved out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who were all those women, in the chairs, do you suppose?&rdquo; asked Miss
      Andrews.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His wives, probably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh....!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or concubines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Andrews was silent. She could still see the waving crowd on the
      wharf, and the banners and kites.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must be at least a prince, with all that retinue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Andrews, thinking rapidly of Aladdin and Marco Polo, of wives and
      concubines and strange barbarous ways, brought herself to say in a nearly
      matter-of-fact voice: &ldquo;But those women all had natural feet. I don't
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Means reached for her <i>Things Chinese</i>; looked up &ldquo;Feet,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Women,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dress,&rdquo; and other headings; finally found an answer, through a happy
      inspiration, under &ldquo;Manchus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it!&rdquo; she explained; and read: &ldquo;'The Manchus do not bind the feet
      of their women.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; Thus Miss Andrews, after a long moment with more than a hint of
      emotional stir in her usually quiet voice: &ldquo;We certainly have a remarkable
      assortment of fellow passengers. That curious silent girl in the middy
      blouse.... traveling alone...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remarkable, and not altogether edifying,&rdquo; observed the practical Miss
      Means.

      CHAPTER II&mdash;BETWEEN THE WORLDS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>OWARD noon Miss
      Means and Miss Andrews were in their chairs on deck, when a gay little
      outburst of laughter caught their attention, and around the canvas screen
      came running the child they had seen on the wharf at Nanking. A sober
      Chinese servant (Miss Means and Miss Andrews were not to know that he was
      a eunuch) followed at a more dignified pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child was dressed in a quilted robe of bright flowered silk, the skirt
      flaring like a bed about the ankles, the sleeves extending down over the
      hands. Her shoes were high, of black cloth with paper soles. Over the robe
      she wore a golden yellow vest, shortsleeved, trimmed with ribbon and
      fastened with gilt buttons. Over her head and shoulders was a hood of fox
      skin worn with the fur inside, tied with ribbons under the chin, and
      decorated, on the top of the head, with the eyes, nose and ears of a fox.
      As she scampered along the deck she lowered her head and charged at the
      big first mate. He smiled, caught her shoulders, spun her about, and set
      her free again; then, nodding pleasantly to the eunuch, he passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the two ladies he paused to say: &ldquo;We are coming into T'aiping, the
      city that gave a name to China's most terrible rebellion. If you care to
      step around to the other side, you'll see something of the quaint life
      along the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems very nice&mdash;the mate,&rdquo; remarked Miss Andrews. &ldquo;I find myself
      wondering who he may have been. He is certainly a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; replied Miss Means coolly, &ldquo;that one doesn't ask that
      question on the China Coast.&rdquo; They found the old river port drab and
      dilapidated, yet rich in the color of teeming human life. The river, as
      usual, was crowded with small craft. Nearly a score of these were awaiting
      the steamer, each evidently housing an entire family under its little arch
      of matting, and each extending bamboo poles with baskets at the ends. As
      the steamer came to a stop, a long row of these baskets appeared at the
      rail, while cries and songs arose from the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little Manchu girl had found a friend in Mr. Rocky Kane. He was
      holding her on the rail and supplying her with brass cash which she
      dropped gaily into the baskets. The eunuch stood smiling by. After tiffin
      the child appeared again and sought her new friend. She would sit on his
      knee and pry open his mouth to see where the strange sounds came from. And
      his cigarettes delighted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the Manila Kid himself who asked Miss Means and Miss Andrews if
      they would mind a bit of a boxing: match in the social hall. They promptly
      withdrew to their cabin, after Miss Means had uttered a bewildered but
      dignified: &ldquo;Not in the least! Don't think of us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after dinner the cabin stewards stretched a rope around four
      pillars, just forward of the dining table. The men lighted cigarettes and
      cigars, and moved up with quickening interest. Tex Connor, who had
      disappeared directly after the coffee, brought in his budding champion, a
      large grinning yellow man in a bathrobe. The second mate, and two of the
      engineers found seats about the improvised rings. Then an outer door
      opened, and the great mandarin appeared, bowing and smiling courteously
      with hands clasped before his breast. The fifteen lesser mandarins
      followed, all rich color and rustling silk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young officers sprang to their feel and arranged chairs for the party.
      The great man seated himself, and his attendants grouped themselves behind
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into this expectant atmosphere came the mate, in knickerbockers and a
      sweater, stooping under the lintel of the door, then straightening up and
      stopping short. His eyes quickly took in the crowded little picture&mdash;the
      gray-bearded mandarin in the ringside chair, backed with a mass of
      Oriental color; that other personage, Dawley Kane, directly opposite, with
      the aquiline nose, the guardedly keen eyes and the quite humorless face,
      as truly a mandarin among the whites as was calm old Kang among the
      yellows; the flushed eager face of Rocky Kane; the other whites, all
      smoking, all watching him sharply, all impatient for the show. He frowned;
      then, as the mandarin smiled, came gravely forward, bent under the rope
      and addressed him briefly in Chinese.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mandarin, frankly pleased at hearing his own tongue, rose to reply.
      Each clasped his own hands and bowed low, with the observance of a
      long-hardened etiquette so dear to the Oriental heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about a little bet?&rdquo; whispered Rocky Kane to Tex Connor. &ldquo;I wouldn't
      mind taking the big fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What odds'll you give?&rdquo; replied the impassive one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Odds nothing! Your man's a trained fighter, and he must be twenty years
      younger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this man Doane's an old athlete. He's boxed, off and on, all his
      life. And he's kept in condition. Look at his weight, and his reach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the distance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;six two-minute rounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who'll referee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;one of the Englishmen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Englishmen were not at hand. A friendly bout between yellow and
      white overstepped their code. One of the customs men, an Australian,
      accepted the responsibility, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll lay you a thousand, even,&rdquo; said Rocky Kane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make it two thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll give you two thousand, even,&rdquo; said Dawley Kane quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Taken! Three thousand, altogether&mdash;gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mate, turning away from the mandarin, caught this; stood motionless
      looking at them, his brows drawing together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he finally remarked, &ldquo;I came here with the understanding that
      it was to be only a little private exercise. I had no objection, of
      course, to your looking on, some of you, but this....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come!&rdquo; said Connor. &ldquo;It's just for points. Tom's not going to fight
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Kane, gripping the rope nervously with both hands, cried: &ldquo;You
      wouldn't quit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mate looked down at these men. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, in the same gravely
      quiet manner, &ldquo;I shall go on with it. I do this&rdquo;&mdash;he made the point
      firmly, with a dignity that in some degree, for the moment, overawed the
      younger men&mdash;&ldquo;I do it because his excellency has paid us the honor of
      coming here in this democratic way. He tells me that he is fond of boxing.
      I shall try to entertain him.&rdquo; And he drew the sweater over his head, and
      caught the gloves that the Kid tossed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder Kane shrewdly took him in. The authority of the man was not to
      be questioned. Without so much as raising his voice he had dominated the
      strange little gathering. Physically he was a delight to the eye; anywhere
      In the forties, his hair thin to the verge of baldness, his strong sober
      face deeply lined, yet with shoulders, arms and chest that spoke of great
      muscular power and a waist without a trace of the added girth that middle
      age usually brings; of sound English stock, doubtless; the sort that in
      the older land would ride to hounds at eighty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dawley Kane looked, then, at the Chinese heavyweight. This man, though not
      quite a match in size for the giant before him, appeared every inch the
      athlete. Kane understood the East too well to find him at all surprising;
      he had seen the strapping northern men of Yuan Shi K'ai's new army; he
      knew that the trained runners of the Imperial Government were expected, on
      occasion, to cover their hundred miles in a day; in a word, that the
      curious common American notion of the Chinese physique was based on an
      occasional glimpse of a tropical laundryman. And he settled back in his
      comfortable chair confident of a run for his money. The occasion promised,
      indeed, excellent entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mate, still with that slight frown, glanced about. Not one of the
      crowded eager faces about the ropes exhibited the slightest interest in
      himself as a human being. He was but the mate of a river steamer; a man
      who had not kept up with his generation (the reason didn't matter)&mdash;an
      individual of no standing.... He put up his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Sung fell into a crouch. With his left shoulder advanced, his chin
      tucked away behind it, he moved in close and darted quick but hard blows to
      the stomach and heart. Duane stepped backward, and edged around him,
      feeling him out, studying his hands and arms, his balance, his footwork.
      It early became clear that he was a thoroughgoing professional, who meant
      to go in and make a fight of it.... Doane, sparring lightly, considered
      this. Conner, of course, had no sportsmanship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom's left hand shot up through Doane's guard, landing clean on his face
      with a sharp thud; followed up with a remarkably quick right swing that
      the mate, by sidestepping, succeeded only in turning into a glancing blow.
      And then, as Doane ducked a left thrust, he uppercut with all his
      strength. The blow landed on Doane's forearms with a force that shook him
      from head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sound of breath sharply indrawn came from the spectators, to most of
      whom it must have appeared that the blow had gone home. Doane, slipping
      away and mopping the sweat from eyes and forehead, heard the sound; and
      for an instant saw them, all leaning forward, tense, eager for a knockout,
      the one possible final thrill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The yellow man was at him again, landing left, right and left on his
      stomach, and butting a shaven head with real force against his chin. For
      an instant stars danced about his eyes. Elbows had followed the head,
      roughing at his face. Doane, quickly recovering, leaped back and dropped
      his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; he called sharply to Connor, whose round expressionless
      face with its one cool light eye and thin little mouth looked at him
      without response. &ldquo;Head? Elbows? Is your man going to box, or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes that turned in surprise about the ringside were not friendly.
      These men cared nothing for his little difficulties; their blood was up.
      They wanted what the Americans among them would term &ldquo;action&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;results.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom was tearing at him again. So it was, after all, to be a fight. No
      preliminary understandings mattered. He felt a profound disgust, as by
      main strength he stopped rush after rush, making full use of his greater
      reach to pin Tom's arms and hurl him back; a disgust however, that was
      changing gradually to anger. He had known, all his life, the peculiar joy
      that comes to a man of great strength and activity in any thorough test of
      his power.
    </p>
    <p>
      The customs man called time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rocky Kane&mdash;flushed, excited, looking like a boy&mdash;felt in his
      pockets for cigarettes; found none; and slipped hurriedly out to the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      There a silken rustle stopped him short.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slim figure, enveloped in an embroidered gown, was moving back from a
      cabin window. The light from within fell&mdash;during a brief second&mdash;full
      on an oval face that was brightly painted, red and white, beneath glossy
      black hair. The nose was straight, and not wide. The eyes, slanted only a
      little, looked brightly out from under penciled brows. She was moving
      swiftly toward the canvas screen; but he, more swiftly, leaped before her,
      stared at her; laughed softly in sheer delighted surprise. Then, with a
      quick glance about the deck, breathing out he knew not what terms of crude
      compliment he reached for her; pursued her to the rail; caught her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You little beauty!&rdquo; he was whispering now. &ldquo;You wonder! You darling!
      You're just too good to be true!&rdquo; Beside himself, laughing again, he bent
      over to kiss her. But she wrenched an arm free, fought him off, and
      leaned, breathless, against the rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little yellow tiger, eh?&rdquo; he cried softly. &ldquo;Well, I'm a big white tiger!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said in English: &ldquo;This is amazing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood frozen until she had disappeared behind the canvas screen. Then
      he staggered back; stumbled against a deck chair; turning, found the
      strange thin girl of the middy blouse stretched out there comfortably in
      her rug.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said, with a cool ease: &ldquo;It's so pleasant out here this evening, I
      really haven't felt like going in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a muttered something&mdash;he knew not what&mdash;he rushed off to
      his cabin; then rushed back into the social hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The customs man called time for the second round.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Doane advanced to the center of the ring, Tom rushed, as before, head
      down. Doane uppercut him; then threw him back, forestalling a clinch. The
      next two or three rushes he met in the same determined but negative way;
      hitting a few blows but for the most part pushing him off. The sweat kept
      running into his eyes as he exerted nearly his full strength. And Tom
      Sung's shoulders and arms glistened a bright yellow under the electric
      lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rocky Kane, lighting a cigarette and tossing the blazing match away,
      called loudly: &ldquo;Oh, hit him! For God's sake, do something! Don't be afraid
      of a Chink!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane glanced over at him. Tom rushed. Doane felt again the crash of solid
      body blows delivered with all the force of more than two hundred pounds of
      well-trained muscle behind them. Again he winced and retreated. He knew
      well that he could endure only a certain amount of this punishment....
      Suddenly Tom struck with the sharpest impact yet. Again that hard head
      butted his chin; an elbow and the heel of a glove roughed his face....
      Doane summoned all his strength to push him off. Then he stepped
      deliberately forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the primitive vigor in this giant was aroused. His eyes blazed.
      There was no manner of pleasure in hurting a fellow man of any color; but
      since the particular man was asking for it, insisting on it, there was no
      longer a choice. The fellow had clearly been trained to this foul sort of
      work. That would be Connor's way, to take every advantage, place a large
      side bet and then make certain of winning. There was, of course, no more
      control of boxing out here on the coast than of gambling or other vice.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Tom next came forward, Doane, paying not the slightest heed to his
      own defense, exchanged blows with him; planted a right swing that raised a
      welt on the yellow cheek. A moment later he landed another on the same
      spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of these blows the men about the ringside straightened up
      with electric excitement. Then again the long muscular right arm swung,
      and the tightly gloved fist crashed through Tom's guard with a force that
      knocked him nearly off his balance. Doane promptly brought him back with a
      left hook that sounded to the now nearly frantic spectators as if it must
      have broken the cheek-bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom crouched, covered and backed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you had enough?&rdquo; Doane asked. As there was no reply, he repeated the
      question in Chinese.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom, instead of answering, tried another rush, floundering wildly,
      swinging his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane stepped firmly forward, swinging up a terrific body blow that caught
      the big Chinaman at the pit of the stomach, lifted his feet clear of the
      floor and dropped him heavily in a sitting position, from which he rolled
      slowly over on his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you trying to do?&rdquo; cried the Manila Kid, above the babel of
      excited voices, as he rushed in there and revived his fellow champion.
      &ldquo;What are you trying to do&mdash;kill 'im?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mate stripped off his wet gloves and tossed them to the floor. &ldquo;Teach
      your man to box fairly,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;or some one else will.&rdquo; With which
      he stepped out of the ring, drew on his sweater and, with a courteous bow
      to the mandarin, went out on deck. There, after depositing with the purser
      the winnings paid over by a surly Connor, Dawley Kane found him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; cried the hitherto calm financier, &ldquo;you put up a remarkable
      fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane looked down at him, unable to reply. He was still breathing hard;
      his thoughts were traveling strange paths. He heard the man saying other
      things; asking, at length, about the mandarin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is Kang Yu,&rdquo; Doane replied now, civilly enough, &ldquo;Viceroy of Nanking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! Really? Why, he was in America!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He toured the world. He has been minister at Paris, Berlin, London, I
      believe. He is a great statesman&mdash;certainly the greatest out here
      since Li Hung Chang.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;how extremely interesting!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is ruler of fifty million souls, or more.&rdquo; The mate had found his
      voice. He was speaking a thought quickly, with a very little heat, as if
      eager to convince the great man of America of the standing and worth of
      this great man of China. &ldquo;He has his own army and his own mint. He
      controls railroads, arsenals, mills and mines. Incidentally, he is
      president of this line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Chinese Navigation Company? Really! You are acquainted with him
      yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But he is a commanding figure hereabouts. And of course, I&mdash;at
      present I'm an employee of the Merchants' Line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! Yes, of course! You seem to speak Chinese.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;&mdash;the mate's voice was dry now&mdash;&ldquo;I speak Chinese.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shuffling sound reached their ears. Both turned. The viceroy had come
      out of the cabin and was advancing toward them, followed by all his
      mandarins. Before them he paused, and again exchanged with the mate the
      charming Eastern greeting. In Chinese he said&mdash;and the language that
      needs only a resonant, cultured voire to exhibit its really great dignity
      and beauty, rolled like music from his tongue: &ldquo;It will give me great
      pleasure, sir, if you will be my guest to-morrow at twelve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mate replied, with a grave smile and a bow: &ldquo;It is a privilege. I am
      your servant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They bowed again, with hands to breast. And all the mandarins bowed. Then
      they moved away in stately silence to their quarters aft.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kane spoke now: &ldquo;How very curious! Very curious!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane said nothing to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They really appear to have charm, these upper class people. It's a pity
      they are so poorly adapted to the modern struggle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane looked down at him, then away. As a man acquainted with the East he
      knew the futility of discussing it with a Western mind; above all with the
      mind of a successful business man, to whom activity, drive, energy, were
      very religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      His own thoughts were ranging swiftly back over two thousand years, to the
      strong civilization of the Han Dynasty, when disciplined Chinese armies
      kept open the overland route to Bactria and Parthia, that the silks and
      porcelains and pearls might travel safely to waiting Roman hands; to the
      later, richer, riper centuries of Tang and Sung, after Rome fell, when
      Chinese civilization stood alone, a majestic fabric in an otherwise
      crumbled and chaotic world&mdash;when certain of the noblest landscapes
      and portraits ever painted were finding expression, when philosophers held
      high dreams of building conflicting dogma into a single structure of
      comprehensive and serene faith. The Chinese alone, down the uncounted
      centuries, had held their racial integrity, their very language. Surely,
      at some mystical but seismic turning of the racial tide, they would rise
      again among the nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      This giant, standing there in sweater and knickerbockers, bareheaded,
      gazing out at the dark river, was not sentimentalizing. He knew well
      enough the present problems. But he saw them with half-Eastern eyes; he
      saw America too, with half-Eastern eyes&mdash;and so he could not talk at
      all to the very able man beside him who saw the West and the world with
      wholly Western eyes. No, it was futile. Even when the great New Yorker,
      who had just won two thousand dollars, gold, spoke with wholly unexpected
      kindness, the gulf between their two minds remained unfathomable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to forgive me, sir&mdash;I do not even know your name, you see&mdash;but,
      frankly, you interest me. You are altogether too much of a man for the
      work you are doing here. That is clear. I would be glad to have you tell
      me what the trouble is. Perhaps I could help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This from the man who held General Railways in the hollow of his hand, and
      Universal Hydro-Electric, and Consolidated Shipping, and the Kane,
      Wilmarth and Cantey banks, a chain that reached literally from sea to sea
      across the great young country that worshiped the shell of political
      freedom as insistently as the Chinese worshiped their ancestors, yet gave
      over the newly vital governing power of finance into wholly irresponsible
      private hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation, grotesque in its beginning, seemed now incredible to Doane.
      He drew a hand across his brow; then spoke, with compelling courtesy but
      with also a dismissive power that the other felt: &ldquo;You are very kind, Mr.
      Kane. At some other time I shall be glad to talk with you. But my hours
      are rather exacting, and I am tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally. You have given a wonderful exhibition of what a man of
      character can do with his body. I wish I had you for a physical trainer.
      And I wish the example might start my boy to thinking more wholesomely...
      Good night!&rdquo; And he extended a friendly hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kane's boy presented himself on the following morning as an acute
      problem. He was about the deck, shortly after breakfast, playing with the
      Manchu child. Then, after eleven, Captain Benjamin handed his mate a note
      that had been scribbled in pencil on a leaf torn from a pocket note-book
      and folded over. It was addressed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Chinese Lady who spoke English last night.&rdquo; And the content was as
      follows: &ldquo;I shouldn't have been rude, but I must see you again. Can't you
      slip around the canvas this evening, late? I'll be watching for you.&rdquo;
       There was no signature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make it out?&rdquo; asked the captain. &ldquo;Old Kang sent it up to me&mdash;asks us
      to speak to the young man. But how'm I to know which young man it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know how it was sent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. The little princess took it back.&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won't be hard to find the man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, just put him wise, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll speak to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute! You thinking of young Kane?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mate inclined his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;you know who he is, don't you? Who they are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane bowed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better use a little tact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane walked back along the deck to cabin sixteen. A fresh breeze blew
      sharply here; the chairs had all been moved across to the other side where
      the sunlight lay warm on the planking. Within the social hall the second
      engineer&mdash;a wistful, shy young Scot&mdash;had brought his battered
      talking machine to the dining table and was grinding out a comic song. Two
      or three of the men were in there, listening, smoking, and sipping
      highballs; Doane saw them as he passed the door. Through the open but
      shuttered window of cabin number twelve came the clicking of a typewriter
      and men's voices, that would be Mr. Kane, discussing his &ldquo;autobiography&rdquo;
       with its author.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before number sixteen, Doane paused; sniffed the air. A curious odor was
      floating out through these shutters, an odor that he knew. He sniffed
      again; then abruptly knocked at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      A drowsy voice answered! &ldquo;What is it? What do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must see you at once,&rdquo; said Doane.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence; then odd sounds&mdash;a faint rattling of glass, a
      scraping, cupboard doors opening and closing. Finally the door opened a
      few inches. There was Rocky Kane, hair tousled, coat, collar and tie
      removed, and shirt open at the neck. Doane looked sharply at his eyes; the
      pupils were abnormally small. And the odor was stronger now and of a
      slightly choking tendency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you looking at me like that for?&rdquo; cried young Kane, shrinking
      back a little way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Doane, &ldquo;you had better let me come in and talk with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What right have you got saying things like that? What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have really said nothing as yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kane, seeming bewildered, allowed the door to swing inward and himself
      stepped back. The big mate came stooping within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your note has been returned,&rdquo; he said shortly; and gave him the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kane accepted it, stared down at it, then sank back on the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this to you!&rdquo; he managed to cry. &ldquo;What right.... what do you mean,
      saying I wrote this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you did. You sent it back by the little girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what if I did! What right&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am here at the request of his excellency, the viceroy of Nanking. You
      have been annoying his daughter. The fact that she chooses, while in her
      father's household, to wear the Manchu dress, does not justify you in
      treating her otherwise than as a lady. Perhaps I can't expect you to
      understand that his exellency is one of the greatest statesmen alive
      to-day. Nor that this young lady was educated in America, knows the
      capitals of Europe better, doubtless, than yourself, and is a princess by
      birth. She went to school in England and to college in Massachusetts. Take
      my advice, and try no more of this sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy was staring at him now, wholly bewildered. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he began
      stumblingly, &ldquo;perhaps I have been a little on the loose. But what of it! A
      fellow has to have some fun, doesn't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mate's eyes were taking in keenly the crowded little room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; cried Kane petulantly, &ldquo;that's all, isn't it? I understand! I'll
      let her alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't feel that an apology might be due?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apologize? To that girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To her father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apologize&mdash;to a Chink?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word grated strangely on Doane's nerves. Suddenly the boy cried out:
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;that's all? There's nothing more you want to say? What are you&mdash;what
      are you looking like that for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sober deep-set eyes of the mate were resting on the high dresser at
      the head of the berths. There, tucked away behind the water caraffe, was a
      small lamp with a base of cloisonné work in blue and gold and a small,
      half globular chimney of soot-blackened glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you looking at? What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy writhed under the steady gaze of this huge man, who rested a big
      hand on the upper berth and gazed gravely down at him; writhed, tossed out
      a protesting arm, got to his feet and stood with a weak effort at
      defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I suppose you'll go to my father!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Well, go ahead! Do it!
      I don't care. I'm of age&mdash;my money's my own. He can't hurt me. And he
      knows I'm on to him. Don't think I don't know some of the things he's done&mdash;he
      and his crowd. Ah, we're not saints, we Kanes! We're good fellows&mdash;we've
      got pep, we succeed&mdash;but we're not saints.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have you been smoking opium?&rdquo; asked the mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't smoke it! I mean I never did. Not until Shanghai. And you needn't
      think the pater hasn't hit the pipe a bit himself. I never saw a lamp
      until he took me to the big Hong dinner at Shanghai last month. They had
      'em there. And it wasn't all they had, either&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are telling me the truth,&rdquo; said the mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;&ldquo;I am. I tell you I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;Then you should have no difficulty in stopping. It would take a
      few weeks to form the habit. You can't smoke another pipe on this boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what right&mdash;good lord, if the pater would drag me out here, away
      from all my friends.... you think I'm a rotter, don't you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My opinion is not in question. I must ask you to give me, now, whatever
      opium you have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, moodily, evidently dwelling in a confusion of sulky resentful
      thoughts, the boy knelt at the cupboard and got out a small card-board
      box.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mate opened it, and found several shells of opium within. He promptly
      pitched it out over the rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is all?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;look in there yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the mate was looking at the suit-case, and at the trunk beneath the
      lower berth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You give me your word that you have no more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's&mdash;all,&rdquo; said the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mate considered this answer; decided to accept it; turned to go. But
      the boy caught at his sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do think I'm a rotter!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Well, maybe I am. Maybe I'm
      spoiled. But what's a fellow to do? My father's a machine&mdash;that's
      what he is&mdash;a ruthless machine. My mother divorced him ten years ago.
      She married that English captain&mdash;got the money out of father for
      them to live on, and now she's divorced him. Where do I get off? I know
      I'm overstrung, nervous. I've always had everything I want. Do you wonder
      that I've begun to look for something new? Perhaps I'm going to hell. I
      know you think so. I can see it in your eyes. But who cares!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane stood a long time at the rail, thinking. The ship's clock in the
      social hall struck eight bells. Faintly his outer ear caught it. It was
      time to join his excellency.

      CHAPTER III&mdash;MISS HUI FEI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE luncheon table
      of his excellency was simply set, with two chairs of carven blackwood,
      behind a high painted screen of six panels. It was at this screen that the
      first mate (left by a smiling attendant) gazed with a frown of
      incredulity. Cap in hand, he stepped back and studied the painting, a
      landscape representing a range of mountains rising above mist in great
      rock-masses, chasms where tortured trees clung, towering, lagged peaks,
      all partly obscured by the softly luminous vapor&mdash;a scene of power
      and beauty. Much of the brighter color had faded into the prevailing tones
      of old ivory yellow shading into some thing near Rembrandt brown; though
      the original, reds and blues still held vividly in the lower right
      foreground, where were pictured very small, exquisite in detail yet of as
      trifling importance in the majestic scheme of the painting as are man and
      his works in all sober Chinese thought when considered in relation to the
      grim majesty of nature, a little friendly cluster of houses, men at work,
      children at play, domestic animals, a stream with a water buffalo, a
      bridge, a wayfarer riding a donkey, and cultivated fields. The ideographic
      signature was in rich old gold, inscribed with unerring decorative
      instinct on a flat rock surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mate bent low and looked closely at the brush-work; then stepped
      around an end panel and examined the texture of the silk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;&mdash;it was a musical deep voice, speaking in the mandarin tongue&mdash;&ldquo;you
      admire my screen, Griggsby Doane.&rdquo; The name was pronounced in English.
    </p>
    <p>
      His excellency wore a short jacket of pale yellow over a skirt of blue,
      both embroidered in large circles of lotus flowers around centers of
      conventional good-fortune designs, in which the swastika was a leading
      motive. His bared head was shaved only at the sides, as the top had long
      been bald. He looked gentle and kind as he stood leaning on his cane and
      extending a wrinkled hand; smiling in the fashion of forthright
      friendship. The thin little gray beard, the unobtrusively courteous eyes,
      the calm manner, all gave him an appearance of simplicity that made it
      momentarily difficult to think of him as the great negotiator of the
      tangled problems of statesmanship involved in the expansion of Japan, the
      man who very nearly convinced Europe of American good faith during the
      agitated discussion and correspondence that arose out of the &ldquo;Open Door&rdquo;
       proposals of John Hay, a man known among the observant and informed in
      London, Paris and Washington as a great statesman and a greater gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought at first&rdquo;&mdash;thus the mate, touched by the fine honor done
      him (an honor that would, he quickly felt, demand tact on the bridge)&mdash;&ldquo;that
      it was a genuine Kuo Hsi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. A copy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I see. A Ming copy&mdash;at least the silk appears to be Ming&mdash;the
      heavy single strand, closely woven. And the seals date very closely. If it
      were woven of double strands, even in the warp alone, I should not
      hesitate to call it a genuine Northern Sung.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You observe closely, Griggsby Doane. It is supposed that Ch'uan Shih made
      this copy.&rdquo; His smile was now less one of kindness and courtesy than, of
      genuine pleasure. &ldquo;You shall see the original.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have that also, Your Excellency?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my home at Huang Chau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never seen a genuine panting of Kuo Hsi. It would be a great
      privilege. I have read some of the sayings attributed to him, as taken
      down by his son. One I recall&mdash;'If the artist, without realizing his
      ideal, paints landscapes with a careless heart, it is like throwing earth
      upon a deity, or casting impurities into the clean wind.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added his excellency, almost eagerly, &ldquo;and this&mdash;'To have in
      landscape the opportunity of seeing water and peaks, of hearing the cry of
      monkeys and the song of birds, without going from the room.'&rdquo; Servants
      appeared bearing covered dishes. His excellency placed the mate in the
      seat commanding the wider view of the river. A clear broth was served,
      followed by stewed shell fish with cassia mushrooms, steamed sharks' fins
      set red with crabmeat and ham, roast duck stuffed with young pine needles,
      and preserved pomegranates, carambolas and plums, followed by small cups
      of rice wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation lingered with the great Sung painters, passing naturally
      then to the conflict during the eleventh and twelfth centuries between the
      free vitality of Buddhist thought and the deadening formalism of the
      Confucian tradition.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Doane's thoughts, as he listened or quietly spoke, dwelt on the
      attainments and character of this great man who was so simple and so
      friendly. His excellency had spoken his own full name, Griggsby Doane,
      which would mean that the wide-reaching, instantly responsive facilities
      for gathering information that may be set at work by the glance of a
      viceroy's eye or a movement of his jeweled finger had been brought into
      play within the twenty-four hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My heart is there in the Sung Dynasty,&rdquo; his excellency said. &ldquo;I never
      look upon the old canals of Hang Chow or the ruins of stone-walled lotus
      gardens by the Si-hu without sadness. And Kai-feng-fu to-day wrings my
      heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; mused Doane, &ldquo;it was in the days of Tang and Sung that the soul
      of China so nearly found its freedom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You indeed understand, Griggsby Doane!&rdquo; The two English words stood out
      with odd emphasis in the musical flow of cultured Chinese speech. &ldquo;Had
      that spirit endured, China would to-day, I like to think, have Korea and
      Manchuria and Mongolia and Sin Kiang. China would not to-day wear a
      piteous smile on the lips, turning the head to hide tears of shame, while
      the Russians absorb our northern frontiers and the French draw tribute
      from Annam and Yunnan, while the English control this great valley of the
      Yangtze, while the Germans drive their mailed fist into Shantung, and the
      Japanese send their spies throughout all our land and stand insolently at
      the very gate of the Forbidden City. I could not, perhaps, speak my heart
      freely to one of my own countrymen, but to you I can say, Confucian
      scholar though they may term me, that since what you call the thirteenth
      century there has been a gradual paralysis of the will in China, a
      softening of the political brain.... You will permit an old man this
      latitude? I have served China without thought of self during nearly fifty
      years. To the Old Buddha I was ever a loyal servant. If toward the new
      emperor and the empress dowager I find it impossible to feel so deeply, my
      heart is yet devoted to the throne and to my people. If while sent abroad
      in service of my country it has been given me to see much of merit in
      Western ways, it is not that I have become a revolutionist, a traitor to
      the government of my ancestors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a light in the kindly eyes; a strong ring in the deep voice. He
      went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am not a traitor. It is not that. It is that my country has
      suffered, is now prostrate, with a long sickness. She must be helped; but
      she must as well help herself. She is like one who has lain too long abed.
      She must think, arise, act. With my poor eyes I can see no other hope for
      her. Even though I myself may suffer, I can not, in truth to my own faith,
      punish those who, loving China as deeply as I myself love her, yet feel
      that they must goad her until she awakens from her pitiful sleep of more
      than six centuries.... Nor am I a republican. China is not like your
      country. In an imperial throne I must believe. Yet, she must listen to
      all, study all, draw from all. Freedom of thought there must be. We must
      not longer worship books and the dead. We must learn to look about us and
      on before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their chairs were drawn about to the window's. Slowly the wide river
      slipped off astern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you, Griggsby Doane, why are you here? This is not the life for which
      you so laboriously and so worthily prepared yourself. I knew of you over
      in T'ainan-fu. You were a true servant of your faith. After the dreadful
      year of the Boxers you returned to your task. And during the trouble in
      nineteen hundred and seven, the fighting with the Great Eye Society in
      Hansi, you conducted yourself with bravery. I was at Sian-fu that year,
      and was well informed. Yet you gave up the church mission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mate's eyes were fixed gloomily on the long vista of the river. For a
      moment it seemed as if he would speak; and the viceroy, seeing his lips
      part, leaned a little way forward; but then the lips were closed tightly
      and the great head bent deliberately forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew,&rdquo; continued his excellency, &ldquo;when the Asiatic Company of New York
      was negotiating with me the contract for rebuilding the banks of the Grand
      Canal in Kiang-su that you had gone from T'ainan, and that you had, as
      well, left the church. You had even gone from China.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was in nineteen nine,&rdquo; said Doane, in the somber voice of one who
      thinks moodily aloud. &ldquo;I was in America then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it was in your year nineteen nine. For a time those negotiations
      hung, I recall, on the question of the means to be employed in dealing
      with local resentments. The trouble over the Ho Shan Company in Hansi, of
      which you knew so much and which you met with such noble courage, had
      taught us all to move with caution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My position in that Hansi trouble has not been clearly understood, Your
      Excellency. I was there only, a short time, and was ill at that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The viceroy smiled, kindly, wisely. &ldquo;You went alone and on foot from
      T'ainan-fu to So T'ung in the face of a Looker attack, and yourself
      settled that tragic business. You then walked, without even a night's
      rest, the fifty-five <i>li</i> from T'ainan to Hung Chan. There, at the
      city gate, you were attacked and severely wounded, and crawled to the
      house of a Christian native. But while still weak and in a fever you
      walked the three hundred <i>li</i> to Ping Yang and made your way through
      the Looker army into Monsieur Pourmont's compound....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pronounced the two words &ldquo;Monsieur Pour-mont&rdquo; in French. What a
      remarkable old man he was&mdash;mentally all alive, sensitive as a youth
      to the quick currents of life! The accuracy of his information, like his
      memory, was surprising. Though to the Westerner, every normal Chinese
      memory is that. Merely learning the language needs or builds a memory....
    </p>
    <p>
      Most surprising was that so deep attention had been given to Doane's own
      small case. The fact bewildered; was slow in coming home. For Kang was a
      great man; his proper preoccupations were many; that he was a poet, and
      had early aspired to the laureateship, was commonly known&mdash;indeed,
      Doane had somewhere his own translation of Kang's <i>Ode to the Rich Earth</i>,
      from the scroll in the author's calligraphy owned by Pao Ting Chuan at
      T'ainan-fu. As an amateur in the art of his own land of fine taste and
      sound historical background he was known everywhere; his collection of
      early paintings, porcelains, jades and jewels being admittedly one of the
      most valuable remaining in China. And he was reputed to be the richest
      individual not of the royal blood (excepting perhaps Yuan Shi K'ai).
    </p>
    <p>
      A contrast, not untinged with a passing bitterness, arose in Doane's mind.
      Here before him quietly sat this so-called yellow man who was more
      competent than perhaps any other to select his own art treasures and write
      his own poems and state papers; whose journals, known to exist, must
      inevitably, if not lost in a war-torn land, take their place as a part of
      China's history; a man who was at once manufacturer, financier, and
      statesman, on whom for a decade a weakening throne had leaned. While in
      the cabin forward was a great white man as truly representative of the new
      civilization as was Kang of the old; yet who hired men of special
      knowledge to select the art treasures that would be left, one day, in his
      name and as a monument to his culture, who even employed a trained writer
      to pen the work that he proposed unblushingly to call his &ldquo;autobiography.&rdquo;
       For such a man as Dawley Kane, whatever his manners, Doane felt now, knew
      only the power of money. Through that alone his genius functioned; the
      rest was a lie. On the one hand was culture, on the other&mdash;something
      else. The thought bit into his brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his excellency had not finished:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there, my dear Griggsby Doane, while still suffering from your wound,
      you learned that those in Monsieur Pourmont's compound were cut off from
      communication with their nationals at Peking. You at once volunteered to
      go again, alone, through the Looker lines to the railhead with messages,
      and successfully did so.... Do you wonder, my dear young friend, that
      knowing this, and more, of your honesty and personal force from my
      one-time assistant, Pao Ting Chuan, of T'ainan-fu, I pressed strongly on
      the gentlemen from New York who represented the Asiatic Company my desire
      that they secure you to act as their resident director? And do you wonder
      that I regretted your refusal so to act?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This statement came to Doane as a surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They offered me a position, yes,&rdquo; he said, pondering on the inexplicable
      ways in which the currents of life meet and cross. &ldquo;But they told me
      nothing of your interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His excellency smiled. &ldquo;It might have raised your price. They would think
      of that. The sharpest trading, Griggsby Doane, is not done in the Orient.
      That I have learned from a long lifetime of struggling against the
      aggressions of white nations. During the discussion of the concerted loan
      to China&mdash;you recall it?&mdash;they talked of lending us a hundred
      million dollars, gold. To read your New York papers was to think that we
      were almost to be given the money. It seemed really a philanthropy. But do
      you know what their left hands were doing while their right hands waved in
      a fine gesture of aid to the struggling China? These were the terms. First
      they subtracted a large commission&mdash;that for the bankers themselves;
      then, what with stipulations of various sorts as to the uses to which the
      money&mdash;or the credit&mdash;was to be put, mostly in purchases of
      railway and war material from their own hongs at further huge profits to
      themselves, they whittled it down until the actual money to be expended
      under our own direction, amounted to about fifteen millions. And with that
      went immense new concessions&mdash;really the signing away of an empire&mdash;and
      new foreign supervision of our internal affairs. For all these privileges
      we were to pay an annual interest and later repay the full amount, one
      hundred millions. It was quite unbearable.&rdquo; He sighed. &ldquo;But what is poor
      old China to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane nodded gravely. &ldquo;I felt all that&mdash;the sort of thing&mdash;when
      I talked with representatives of the Asiatic Company. Not that I blamed
      them, of course. It is a point of view much larger than any of them; they
      are but part of a great tendency. I couldn't go into it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; The viceroy's keen eyes dropped to the slightly faded blue
      uniform, then rested again on the strong face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The past few years&mdash;I will pass over the details&mdash;have been&mdash;well,
      not altogether happy for me. I have been puzzled. All the rich years of my
      younger manhood were given to the mission work. But I had to leave the
      church. At first I felt a joy in simple hard work&mdash;I am very strong&mdash;but
      hard work alone could not satisfy my thoughts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.... No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a time I believed that the solution of my personal problem lay in
      taking the plunge into commercial life. I had come to feel, out there,
      that business was, after all, the natural expression of man's active
      nature in our time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Doubtless it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was in that state of mind that I returned home&mdash;to the States.
      But it proved impossible. I am not a trader. It was too late. My
      character, such as it was and is, had been formed and hardened in another
      mold. I talked with old friends, but only to discover that we had between
      us no common tongue of the spirit. Perhaps if I had entered business
      early, as they did, I, too, would have found my early ideals being warped
      gradually around to the prevailing point of view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The point stands out, though,&rdquo; said the viceroy, &ldquo;that you did not enter
      business. You chose a more difficult course, and one which leaves you, in
      ripe middle age, without the means to direct your life effectively and in
      comfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; mused Doane, though without bitterness. &ldquo;I feel that, of course.
      And it is hard, very hard, to lose one's country. Yet....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice dropped. He sat, elbow on crossed knees, staring at the
      ever-changing river. When he spoke again, the bitter undertone was no
      longer in his voice. He was gentler, but puzzled; a man who has suffered a
      loss that he can not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All my traditions,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my memories of America, were of simple
      friendly communities, a land of earnest religion, of political freedom. In
      my thoughts as a younger man certain great figures stood out&mdash;Washington,
      Lincoln, Charles Sumner, Wendell Philips, Philips Brooks and&mdash;yes,
      Henry Ward Beecher. I had deeply felt Emerson, Longfellow, Lowell and
      Whittier. The Declaration of Independence could still fire my blood. And
      it was such a land of simple faith that I tried for so many years, however
      ineffectually, to represent here in China. To be sure, disquieting
      thoughts came&mdash;church disunity, the spectacle of unbridled license
      among so many of my fellow countrymen in the coast ports, the methods of
      certain of our great corporations in pushing their wares in among your
      people. But even when I found it necessary to leave the church, I still
      believed deeply in my country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused to control a slight unsteadiness of voice; then went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask if you, Your Excellency, after your long visits in Europe, have
      not come home to meet with something the same difficulty, to find yourself
      looking at your own people with the eyes of a stranger, receiving such an
      impression as only a stranger can receive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, yes!&rdquo; cried the viceroy softly, with deep feeling. &ldquo;It is the
      most difficult moment, I have sometimes felt, in a man's life. It is the
      summit of loneliness, for there is no man among his friends who can share
      his view, and there is none who would not misunderstand and censure him.
      And yet, a country, a people, like a city, does present to the alien eye,
      a complete impression, it exhibits clearly outlined characteristics that
      can be observed in no other way. Even the alien lose that clear, true
      impression on very short acquaintance. He then becomes, like all the
      others, a part of the picture he has once seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so, Your Excellency. My country, in that first, startled, clear
      glance, affected me&mdash;I may as well use the word&mdash;unpleasantly.
      It was utterly different from anything I had known, a trader's paradise, a
      place of unbelievable confusion, of an activity that bewildered, rushing
      to what end I could not understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was speaking now not only in the Chinese language but in the idiom as
      well, generalizing rhetorically as the Chinese do. It was almost as if the
      words came from a Chinese mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were silent for a time Then the viceroy asked, in his gently abrupt
      way: &ldquo;Why did you leave the church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I sinned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Against the church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, and my own faith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you asked to leave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They knew of your sin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet they would have kept you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. My own feeling was that my superior temporized.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knew your value.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can not say as to that. But he wished me to marry again. I couldn't do
      that&mdash;not in the spirit intended. Not as I felt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are different, Griggsby Doane, you and I. I am a Manchu, you an
      American. The customs of our two lands are very different. What would seem
      a sin to you, might not seem so to me. Yet I, too, have a conscience to
      which I must answer. I believe I understand you. It is, I see, because of
      your conscience that you sit before me now, on this boat and in this
      uniform, a man, as your great Edward Everett Hale has phrased it, without
      a country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and filled again the little pipe-bowl, studied it absently as
      his wrinkled fingers worked the tobacco. His nails were trimmed short,
      like those of a white man. Doane thought, swiftly, of the man's dramatic
      past, sent out as he had been to become a citizen of the world by a nation
      that would in very necessity fail to understand the resulting changes in
      his outlook. There was his daughter; she would be almost an American,
      after four years of college life. And she, now, would be a problem indeed!
      What could he hope to make of her life in this Asia where woman, like
      labor in his own country, was a commodity. It would be absorbingly
      interesting, were it possible, to peep into that smooth-running old brain
      and glimpse the problems there. They were gossiping about him. His stately
      figure was to-day the center about which coiled the life and death
      intrigue of Chinese officialdom and over which hung suspended the silken
      power of an Oriental throne.... Doane's personal problem shrank into
      nothing&mdash;a flitting memory of a little outbreak of egotism&mdash;as
      he studied the old face on which the revealing hand of Age had inscribed
      wisdom, kindliness and shrewdness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soft footfalls sounded; then, after a moment, a sharper sound that Doane
      assumed, with a slight quickening of the imagination, to be the high
      wooden clogs of a Manchu lady, until he realized that no clogs could move
      so lightly; no, these were little Western shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young woman appeared, slender and comely, dressed in a tailored suit
      that could have come only front New York, and smiling with shy eagerness.
      She was of good height (like the Manchus of the old stock), the face
      nearly oval, quite unpainted and softly pretty, with a broad forehead that
      curved prettily back under the parted hair, arched eyebrows, eyes more
      nearly straight than slanting (that opened a thought less widely than
      those of Western people), and with a quaint, wholly charming friendliness
      in her smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt her sense of freedom; and knew as she tried to take his huge hand
      in her own small one that she carried her Western ways, as her own people
      would phrase it, with a proud heart. She was of those aliens who would be
      happily American, eager to show her kinship with the great land of fine
      free traditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      And holding the small hand, looking down at her, Doane found his perhaps
      overstrained nerves responding warmly to her fine youth and health. He
      reflected, in that swift way of his wide-ranging mind, on the amazing
      change in Chinese official life that made it even remotely possible for
      the viceroy to present his daughter with a heart as proud as hers. The
      change had come about during the term of Doane's own residence....
      America, then, was not alone in changing. It was a shaking, puzzled and
      puzzling world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; his excellency was saying, &ldquo;is my daughter, Hui Fei.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very pleas' to meet you,&rdquo; said Hui Fei.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat then. The girl became at once, as in America, the center of the
      talk. Though of the heedlessness not uncommonly found among American girls
      she had none. She was prettily, sensitively, deferential to her father.
      Somewhere back of the bright surface brain from which came the quick eager
      talk and the friendly smile, deep in her nature, lay the sense of
      reverence for those riper in years and in authority that was the deepest
      strain in her race. She dwelt on things almost utterly American: the
      brightness of New York&mdash;she said she liked it best in October, when
      the shops were gay; the approaching Yale-Harvard football game, a motoring
      tour through the White Mountains, happy summers at the seashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane watched her, speaking only at intervals, wondering if there might
      not be, behind her gentle enthusiasm, some deeper understanding of her
      present situation. He could not surely make out. She had humor, and when
      he asked if it did not seem strange to step abruptly back into the old
      life, she spoke laughingly of her many little mistakes in etiquette. Her
      English he found charming. She was continually slipping back into it from
      the Mandarin tongue she tried to use, and as continually, with great
      gaiety, reaching back into Chinese for the equivalent phrase. She had so
      nearly conquered the usual difficulty with the l's and r's as to confuse
      them only when she spoke hurriedly. At these times, too, she would leave
      off final consonants. The long <i>e</i> became then, a short <i>i</i>.
      Doane even smiled, with an inner sense of pleasure, at her pretty emphasis
      when she once converted <i>people</i> into <i>pipple</i>. She was,
      unmistakably, a young woman of charm and personality. Despite the
      quaintness of her speech, she was accustomed to thinking in the new
      tongue. Her command of it was excellent; better than would commonly be
      found in America. All of which, of course, intensified the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      His excellency sat back, smoked comfortably, and looked on her with
      frankly indulgent pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      A servant came with a message; bowing low. The viceroy excused himself,
      leaving his daughter and Doane together. Doane asked himself, during the
      pause that followed his departure, what the observant attendants beyond
      the screen would be thinking. The situation, from any familiar Chinese
      point of view, was unthinkable. Yet here he sat; and there, her brows
      drawn together (he saw now) in sober thought, sat delightful Miss Hui Fei.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said, in a low voice, while looking out at the river: &ldquo;Mr. Doane, no
      matter what you may think&mdash;I mus' see you. This evening. You mus'
      tell me where. It mus' not be known to any one. There are spies here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane glanced up; then, too, looked away. There could be no question now
      of the girl's deeper feeling. She was determined. Her tune was honest and
      forthright, with the unthinking courage of youth. It would be her father,
      of course...
    </p>
    <p>
      But his mind had gone blank. He knew not what to think or say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;There is no one else. You must help us. Tell me&mdash;father
      will be coming back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then Griggsby Doane heard his own voice saying quietly: &ldquo;The boat deck
      is the only place. You will find a sort of ladder near the stern. If you
      can&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go up there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be only just after midnight that I could arrange to be there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His excellency returned then. And Doane took his leave. He had been but a
      few moments in his own cabin when two actors of his excellency's suite
      appeared, each with a lacquered tray, on one of which was a small chest of
      tea, wrapped in red paper lettered in gold and bearing the seal stamp of
      the private estate of Kang Yu, on the other an object of more than a foot
      in height carefully wound about with cotton cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane dismissed the lictors with a Mexican dollar each and unwrapped the
      larger object, which the servant had placed with great care on his berth.
      It proved to be a <i>pi</i>, a disk of carven jade, in color a perfect
      specimen of the pure greenish-white tint that is so highly prized by
      Chinese collectors. The diameter was hardly less than ten inches, and the
      actual width of the stone from the circular inner opening to the outer rim
      about four inches. It stood on edge set in a pedestal of blackwood, the
      carving of which was of unusual delicacy. The pedestal was, naturally,
      modern, but Doane, with a mounting pulse, studied the designs cut into the
      stone itself. That cutting had been done not later than the Han Dynasty,
      certainly within two hundred years of the birth of Christ.

      CHAPTER IV&mdash;INTRIGUE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE <i>Yen Hsin</i>
      would arrive at Kiu Kiang by mid-afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour earlier. Doane, on the lower deck, came upon a group of his
      excellency's soldiers&mdash;brown deep-chested men, picturesque in their
      loose blue trousers bound in above the ankles and their blue turbans and
      gray cartridge belts&mdash;conversing excitedly in whispers behind the
      stack of coffins near the stern. At sight of him they broke up and slipped
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later, passing forward along the corridor beside the engine room,
      he heard his name: &ldquo;Mr. Doane! If you please!&rdquo; This in English.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned. Just within the doorway of one of the low-priced cabins stood a
      pedler he had observed about the lower decks; a thin Chinese with an
      overbred head that was shaped, beneath the cap, like a skull without flesh
      upon it; the eyes concealed behind smoked glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I have a word with you, Mr. Doane?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mate considered; then, stooping, entered the tiny cabin. The pedler
      closed the door; quietly shot the bolt; then removed his cap and the queue
      with it, exposing a full head of stubbly black hair, trimmed, as is said,
      pompadour. The glasses came off next; discovering wide alert eyes. And
      now, without the cap, the head, despite the hair and the seriously
      intellectual face, looked, balanced on its thin neck, more than ever like
      a skull.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not know of me, Mr. Doane. I am Sun Shi-pi of Shanghai. I was
      attached, as interpreter, to the yamen of the tao-tai. I left his service
      some months ago to join the republican revolutionary party. I was arrested
      shortly after that at Nanking and condemned to death, but his excellency,
      the viceroy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kang?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He is on this boat. He released me on condition that I go to Japan.
      I kept my word&mdash;to that extent; I went to Japan&mdash;but I could not
      keep my word in spirit. My life is consecrated to the cause of the Chinese
      Republic. Nothing else matters. I returned to Shanghai, and was made
      commander there of the 'Dare-to-dies.' You did not know of such an
      organization? You will, then, before the winter is gone. We shall be heard
      from. There are other such companies&mdash;at Canton, at Wuchang&mdash;at
      Nanking&mdash;at every center.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane seated himself on the narrow couch and studied the quietly eager
      young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak English with remarkable ease,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. I studied at Chicago University. And at Tokio University I took
      post-graduate work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are frank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can trust you. You are known to us, Mr. Doane. Wu Ting Fang trusts you&mdash;and
      Sun Yat Sen, our leader, he knows and trusts you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did know Sun Yat Sen, when he was a medical student.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows you well. He has mentioned your name to us. That is why I am
      speaking to you. America is with us. We can trust Americans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane's mind was ranging swiftly about the situation. &ldquo;You are running a
      risk,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sun Shi-pi shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;I shall hardly survive the revolution.
      That is not expected among the 'Dare-to-dies.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If his excellency's soldiers find you here they will kill you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The officers would, of course. Many of the soldiers are with us. Anyway,
      it doesn't matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your errand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you. The revolution, as you doubtless know, is fully
      planned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've assumed so. There has been so much talk. And then, of course, the
      outbreak in Szechuen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was premature. It was the plan to strike in the spring. This
      fighting in Szechuen has caused much confusion. Sun Yat Sen is in America.
      He is going to England, and can hardly reach China within two months. He
      will bring money enough for all our needs. He is the organizer, the
      directing genius of the new republic. But the Szechuen outbreak has set
      all the young hotheads afire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am told that the throne has sent Tuan Fang out there to put down the
      disturbance. But we have had no news lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is because the wires are cut. Tuan Fang will never come back. We
      will pay five thousand taels, cash, to the bearer of his head, and ask no
      questions. We must exterminate the Manchus. It has finally come down to
      that. It is the only way out. But we must pull together. Did you know that
      the Wu Chang republicans plan to strike at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been sent there to tell them to wait. That is our gravest danger
      now. If we pull together we shall win. If our emotions run away with our
      judgment&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The throne will defeat your forces piecemeal and destroy your morale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. My one fear is that I may not reach Wu Chang in time. But&rdquo;&mdash;with
      a careless gesture&mdash;&ldquo;that is as it may be. I will tell you now why I
      spoke to you. We need you. Our organization is incomplete as yet,
      naturally. One matter of the greatest importance is that our spirit be
      understood from the first by foreign countries. There is an enormous task&mdash;diplomatic
      publicity, you might call it&mdash;which you, Mr. Doane, are peculiarly
      fitted to undertake You know both China and the West. You are a
      philosopher of mature judgment. You would work in association with Doctor
      Wu Ting Fang at our Shanghai offices. There will be money. Will you
      consider this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a wholly new thought,&rdquo; Doane replied slowly. &ldquo;I should have to give
      it very serious consideration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are in sympathy with our aims?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a general way, certainly. Even though I may not share your optimism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On your return to Shanghai would you be willing to call at once on Doctor
      Wu and discuss the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.... Yes, I will do that. I must leave you now. We are nearly at Kiu
      Kiang.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sun, glancing out the window, raised his hand. Doane looked; two small
      German cruisers, the kaiser's flag at the taff, were steaming up-stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They know,&rdquo; murmured Sun, with meaning. &ldquo;I wish to God I could find their
      means of information. They <i>all</i> know. From the Japanese in
      particular nothing seems to be hidden. Two or three of your American
      war-ships are already up there. And the English, naturally, in force.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must be on hand to protect the foreign colony at Hankow. The
      Szechuen trouble would justify such a move.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Sun shook his head. &ldquo;They <i>know</i>,&rdquo; he repeated. Then he clasped
      Doane's hand. &ldquo;However.... that is a detail. It is now war. You will find
      events marching fast&mdash;faster, I fear, than we republicans wish.
      Good-by now. You will call on Doctor Wu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The steamer moved slowly in toward the landing hulk. Doane, from the boat
      deck, by the after bell pull, gazed across at the park-like foreign bund,
      with its embankment of masonry and its trees. Behind lay, compactly, the
      walled city. Everything looked as it had always looked&mdash;the curious
      crowd along the railing, the water carriers passing down and up the steps,
      the eager shouting swarm of water beggars. Below, the coolies swung out
      from the hulk, ready to make their usual breakneck leap over green water
      to the approaching steamer. Now&mdash;they were jumping. The passengers
      were leaning out from the promenade deck to watch and applaud.... Doane's
      thoughts, as he went mechanically through his familiar duties, wandered
      off inland, past the battlements and towers of the ancient city to the
      thousands of other ancient cities and villages and farmsteads beyond; and
      he wondered if the scores of millions of lethargic minds in all those
      centers of population could really be awakened from their sleep of six
      hundred years and stirred into action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could a republic, he asked himself, possibly mean anything real to those
      minds? The habit of mere endurance, of bare existence, was so deep-seated,
      the struggle to live so intense, the opportunity so slight. Sun Shi-pi and
      his kind were a semi-Western product. They were, when all was said and
      done, an exotic breed. They were the ardent, adventurous young; and they
      were the few. There had always been a throne in China, always extortionate
      mandarins, always a popular acceptance of conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lines were out now. And suddenly a blue-clad soldier climbed over the
      rail, below, balanced along the stern hawser, leaped to the hulk, and was
      about to disappear among the coolies there when a rifle-shot cracked and
      he fell. He seemed to fall, if anything, slightly before the shot. Another
      soldier, following close, was caught by a second shot as he was balancing
      on the hawser, and spun headlong into the water where the propeller still
      churned.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later, when Doane moved among the passengers, it became
      clear that they knew nothing of the casual tragedy astern. They were all
      pressing ashore for a walk in the native city, eager to buy the worked
      silver that is traditionally sold there. The slim girl in the middy blouse
      had apparently captured young Rocky Kane; they strolled off across the
      bund together. But Dawley Kane remained aboard, stretched out comfortably
      in a deck chair, listening thoughtfully to the stocky little Japanese, one
      Kato, who was by now generally known to be his <i>alter ego</i> in the
      matter of buying objects of Oriental art.
    </p>
    <p>
      None of these folk knew or cared about China. Excepting this Kato. Him
      Doane was continually encountering below decks, chatting smilingly in
      Chinese with the good-natured soldiers. His work along the river,
      doubtless, ranged over a wider field than his present employer would ever
      learn. It would be interesting, now, to know what he was saying, talking
      so rapidly and always, of course, smiling.... The rest of this upper-deck
      white man's existence Doane dismissed from his mind as he went about his
      work. It was all too familiar. Though later he thought of Rocky Kane. The
      boy, wild though he might be, had attractive qualities. It was not
      pleasant to see that girl get her hands on him. Just one more evil
      influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought, at this juncture, of the&mdash;the word came&mdash;appalling
      change in himself. That he, once a fervid missionary, could stand back
      like a sophisticated European, and let the wandering and vicious and
      broken human creatures about him go their various ways, as might be, was
      disturbing, was even saddening. Something apparently had died in him. Sun
      had called him a philosopher. The Oriental, of course, even the blazing
      revolutionist, admired this passive quality, this fatalistic acceptance of
      the fact. He sighed. To be a philosopher was, then, to be emotionally
      dead. The church had been taken out of his life, leaving&mdash;nothing. A
      mate on a river steamer, in China. Life had gone quite topsy-turvey. Even
      the amazing courtesy of his excellency&mdash;it was that, when you
      considered&mdash;and this profound compliment from the revolutionary junta
      seemed but incidents. Too many promises had smiled at Doane, these years
      of his spiritual Odyssey&mdash;smiled and faded to nothing&mdash;to permit
      an easy hope of anything new and beautiful. He was beginning to believe
      that a man can not build and live two lives. And he had built and lived
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Benjamin found him; a dogged little captain with dull fright in
      his eyes. &ldquo;It's happened,&rdquo; he said, trying desperately to attain an
      offhand manner. &ldquo;Company wire. They're fighting at Wu Chang. What do you
      know about that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane was silent. It was extraordinarily difficult, here by this calm old
      city, on a sunny afternoon, to believe that it was, as Sun had put it,
      war.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're to tie up,&rdquo; the captain went on, &ldquo;until further orders. The foreign
      concessions at Hankow were safe enough this noon, but with an artillery
      battle just across the river, and an imperial army moving down from the
      north over the railway, they stand a lot of show, they do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if they'll send us on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What difference will it make?&rdquo; The captain's voice was rising. &ldquo;You know
      as well as I do that they'll be fighting at Nanking before we could get
      back there. Here, too, for that matter. I tell you the whole river'll be
      ablaze by to-morrow. This bloody old river! And us on a Manchu-owned boat!
      A lot o' chance we stand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sight-seers strolled across the shady bund, passed a stone residence
      or two and a warehouse, and made their way through the tunneled gateway in
      the massive city wall. Little Miss Andrews was escorted by young Mr.
      Braker. Miss Means walked with one of the customs men. Two or three others
      of the men wandered on ahead. Rocky Kane and the thin girl in the middy
      blouse brought up the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they entered the crowded city within the wall a babel of sound assailed
      their ears&mdash;the beating of drums and gongs, clanging cymbals, a
      musket shot or two, fire-crackers; and underlying these, rising even above
      them, never slackening, a continuous roar of voices. The teachers paused
      in alarm, but the customs man smilingly assured them that in a busy
      Chinese city the noise was to be taken for granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly every shop along the way was open to the street, and at each
      opening men swarmed&mdash;bargaining, chaffering, quarreling. The only
      women to be seen were those in black trousers on a wheelbarrow that pushed
      briskly through the crowds, the barrow man shouting musically as he
      shuffled along. Beggars wailed from the niches between the buildings. Dogs
      snarled and barked&mdash;hundreds of dogs, fighting over scraps of offal
      among the hundreds of nearly naked children.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mandarin came through in a chair of green lacquer and rich gold
      ornament, supercilious, fat, carried by four bearers and followed by
      imposing officials who wore robes of black and red and hats with red
      plumes. As the street was a scant ten feet in width and the crowds must
      flatten against the walls to make way the roar grew louder and higher in
      pitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were shops with nothing but oils in huge jars of earthenware or in
      wicker baskets lined with stout paper. There were tea shops with high
      pyramids of the familiar red-and-gold parcels, and other pyramids of the
      brick tea that is carried on camel back to Russia. There were the shops of
      the idol makers, and others where were displayed the carven animals and
      the houses and carts and implements that are burned in ancestor worship,
      and the tinsel shoes. There were shops where remarkably large coffins were
      piled in square heaps, some of glistening lacquer with the ideograph
      characters carven or embossed in new gold. There were varnishers,
      lacquerers, tobacconists; open eating houses in which could be seen rows
      of pans set into brickwork. There were displays of bean cakes, melon seeds
      and curious drugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two Manchu soldiers sauntered by, in uniforms of red and faded blue; fans
      stuck in their belts and painted paper umbrellas folded in their hands.
      One bore a hooded falcon on his wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Andrews sniffed the penetrating odor of all China, that was spiced
      just here with smells of garlic cooking and frying fish and pork and
      strong oil? and&mdash;like the perfume of a dainty lady amid the complex
      odors of a French theater&mdash;an unexpected whiff of burning incense.
      She looked up between the high walls, on which hung, close together, the
      long elaborate signs of the tradesmen, black and green and red with gold,
      always the gold. Across the narrow opening from roof to roof, extended a
      bamboo framework over which was drawn coarse yellow matting or blue cotton
      cloths; and through these the sunbeams, diffused, glowed in a warm
      twilight, with here and there a chance ray slanting down with dazzling
      brightness on a golden sign character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all rather terrifying,&rdquo; murmured Miss Andrews, at Braker's ear, &ldquo;but
      it's beautiful&mdash;wonderful! I never dreamed of China being so human
      and real.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to think,&rdquo; said he eagerly, &ldquo;that it has always been like this, and
      always will be. It was just so in the days of Abraham and Isaac. The one
      people in the world that doesn't change. It's their whole philosophy&mdash;passive
      non-resistance, peace. And-do you know, I'm beginning to wonder if they
      aren't right about it. For here they are, you know. Greece is dead. Rome's
      dead. And Assyria, and Egypt. But here they are. It's their philosophy
      that's done it, I suppose. Almost be worth while to come out here and live
      a while, when our part of the world gets too upset. Just for a sense of
      stability&mdash;somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These two young persons, dreaming of stability while the earth prepared to
      rock beneath their feet!
    </p>
    <p>
      Rocky Kane and the slim girl had dropped out of sight, lingering at this
      shop and that. The party later found them at a silversmith's counter. They
      had bought a heap of the silver dragon-boxes and cigarette cases; and then
      devised a fresh little idea in gambling, weighing ten Chinese dollars
      against other ten in the balanced scales, the heavier lot winning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Kane had got through his clothing, somehow, there in the street, to
      his money belt, for he held it now carelessly rolled in one hand. He was
      flushed, laughing softly. He and the thin girl were getting on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, you two,&rdquo; remarked the customs man. &ldquo;We stop only two hours
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young couple, gathering up their purchases and the heaps of silver
      dollars, slowly followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was great!&rdquo; exclaimed Rocky Kane. The thin girl, he had decided, was
      a good fellow. She was always quiet, discreet, attractive. In her
      curiously unobtrusive way she seemed to know everything. The face was cold
      in appearance. Yet she was distinctly friendly. Made you feel that nothing
      you might say could disturb or shock her. He wondered what could be going
      on behind those pale quiet eyes, behind the thin lips. The men had
      remarked on the fact that she was traveling alone. She was a provocative
      person&mdash;the curiously youthful costume; the black hair gathered at
      the neck and tied, girlishly, with a bow&mdash;really an exciting person.
      The way she had taken that little scene out on deck with the gorgeous
      Chinese girl&mdash;Rocky knew nothing of the distinctions between the
      Asiatic peoples&mdash;who spoke English; quite as a matter of course.
      Though she took everything that way. This little gambling, for instance.
      She loved it&mdash;was quick at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm wondering about you,&rdquo; he said, as they wandered along. &ldquo;Wondering&mdash;you
      know&mdash;why you're traveling this way. Have you got folks up the
      river?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; she replied&mdash;never in his life had he known such
      self-control; there wasn't even color in her voice, just that easy quiet
      way, that sense of giving out no vitality whatever. &ldquo;Oh, no. I have some
      business at Hankow and Peking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was all she said. The subject was closed. And yet, she hadn't minded
      his asking. She was still friendly; he felt that. His feelings rose. He
      giggled softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if only the pater wasn't along!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he hold you down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he? Brought me out here to discipline me. Trying to make me go back
      to college&mdash;make a grind of me.... I was just thinking&mdash;here's a
      nice girl to play with, and plenty of fun around, and not a thing to
      drink. He gave me fits at Shanghai because I took a few drinks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have the other stuff,&rdquo; said she. He turned nervously; stared at her.
      But she remained as calmly unresponsive as ever. Merely explained: &ldquo;I
      smelt it, outside your cabin. You ought to be careful&mdash;shut your
      window tight when you smoke it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held his breath a moment; then realized, with an uprush of feeling
      warmer than any he had felt before, that he had her sympathy. She would
      never tell, never in the world. That big mate might, but she wouldn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      She added this: &ldquo;I can give you a drink. Wait until things settle down on
      the boat and come to my cabin&mdash;number four. Just be sure there's no
      one in the corridor. And don't knock. The door will be ajar. Step right
      in. Do you like saké?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I&mdash;say, you're great! You're wonderful. I never knew a girl like
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took this little outbreak, as she had taken all his others, without
      even a smile. It was, he felt, as if they had always known each other.
      They understood&mdash;perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had been told, then, that this girl had been during two or three
      vivid years one of the most conspicuous underworld characters along the
      coast&mdash;that coast where the underworld was still, at the time of our
      narrative, openly part of what small white world there was out here&mdash;a
      gambler and blackmailer of what would very nearly have to be called
      attainment&mdash;he would have found belief impossible, would have
      defended her with the blind impulsiveness of youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was said that the steamer would not proceed at the scheduled hour,
      might be delayed until night. Disgruntled white passengers settled down,
      in berth and deck chair, to make the best of it. There was, it came
      vaguely to light, a little trouble up the river, an outbreak of some sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rocky Kane, a flush below his temples, slipped stealthily along the
      corridor. At number four he paused; glanced nervously about; then,
      grinning, pushed open the door and softly closed it behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strange thin Miss Carmichael was combing out her black hair. With a
      confused little laugh he extended his arms. But she shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down and be sensible,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Here's the saké.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She produced a bottle and poured a small drink into a large glass. He
      gulped it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you drinking with me?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never take anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a funny girl. How'd you come to have this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was given to me. You'd better slip along. I can't ask you to stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when am I going to see you, for a good visit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there'll be chances enough. Here we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so. Looks as if we'd stay here a while, too. There's a battle on,
      you know, up at Wu Chang and Hankow. Big row. We get all the news from
      Kato. He's that Japanese that father has with him. The revolutionists have
      captured Wu Chang, and are getting ready to cross over. The imperial
      army's being rushed down to defend Hankow. Regular doings. Shells were
      falling in the foreign concessions this morning. Kato's got all the news
      there is. It's a question whether we'll go on at all. You see the Manchus
      own this boat, and the republicans would certainly get after us. There are
      enough foreign warships up there to protect us, of course.... How about
      another drink?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better not. Your father will notice it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won't know where I got it.&rdquo; Rocky chuckled. He felt himself an
      adventurous and quite manly old devil&mdash;here in the mysterious girl's
      cabin, watching her as she smoothed and tied her flowing hair, and sipping
      the potent liquor from Japan. &ldquo;It's funny nothing seems to surprise you.
      Did you know they were fighting up there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn't you be a little frightened if we were to steam right into a
      battle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't enjoy it particularly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you even interested? Is there anything you're interested in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly&mdash;I have my interests. You must go&mdash;really.... No, be
      quiet! Some one will hear! We can visit to-night&mdash;out on deck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you're&mdash;I don't understand! Here we are&mdash;like this&mdash;and
      you shoo me out. I don't even know your first name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Dixie&mdash;but I don't want you to call me that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? We're friends, aren't we&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, but they'd hear you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait&mdash;I'll look before you go.... It's all clear now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They visited long after dinner. He was brimming with later advices from
      the center of trouble up the river. Mostly she listened, studying him with
      a mind that was keener and quicker and shrewder in its sordid wisdom than
      he would perhaps ever understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything that Kato had told his father and himself he passed eagerly on
      to her. He was a man indeed now; making an enormous impression; possessor
      of inside information of a vital sort&mdash;the viceroy's priceless
      collection of jewels, jades, porcelains and historic paintings, which Kato
      was advising his father to pick up for a song while red revolution raged
      about the old Manchu, the dramatic plans of the republicans, their emblems
      and a pass-word (Kato knew everything)&mdash;&ldquo;Shui-li&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;union is
      strength&rdquo;; the small meeting below decks ending in the death of two
      soldiers. He dramatized this last as he related it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl, lying still in her chair, listened as if but casually
      interested, while her mind gathered and related to one another the
      probable facts beneath his words. She was considering his dominant quality
      of ungoverned hot-blooded youth. Of discretion he clearly enough had none;
      which fact, viewed from her standpoint, was both important and dangerous.
      For the information he so volubly conveyed she had immediate use. That was
      settled, however cloudy the details. But this further question as to the
      advisability of holding the boy personally to herself she was still
      weighing. Two courses of action lay before her, each leading to a possible
      rich prize. If the two could be combined, well and good; she would pursue
      both. But it was not easy to sense out a possible combination. The obvious
      first thought was to go whole-heartedly after the larger of the prizes and
      as whole-heartedly forget the other. As usual in all such choices,
      however, the lesser prize was the easier to secure. Perhaps, even, by
      working&mdash;the word &ldquo;working&rdquo; was her own&mdash;with great rapidity she
      might make&mdash;again her word&mdash;a killing with this wild youth in
      time to discard him and pursue the still richer prize.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because he was, at least, the bird in hand, she submitted passively when
      his fingers found hers under the steamer rug. Twilight was thickening into
      night now on the river. And they were in a dim corner. He was, she saw, at
      the point of almost utter disorganization. He was sensitive, emotional,
      quite spoiled. It was almost too easy to do what she might choose with
      him. It would be amusing to tantalize him, if there were time; watch him
      struggle in the net of his own nervously unripe emotions, perhaps shake
      him down (we are yet again dropping into her phraseology) without the
      surrender of a <i>quid pro quo</i>. That would please her sense of cool
      sharp power. But he might in that event, like the young naval officer down
      at Hong Kong, shoot himself; which wouldn't do. No, nothing in that!
    </p>
    <p>
      This other larger matter, now, was a problem indeed; really, as yet, only
      a haze in her sensitive, strangely gifted mind. It put to the test at once
      her imagination, her instinct for dangerous enterprise, her skill at
      organizing the sluggish minds of others. It would mean dangerous and
      intense activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked, in a careless manner, where the viceroy kept his treasures; and
      fixed in her mind the place he named&mdash;Huang Chau.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fool was squeezing her fingers now; unquestionably building in his
      ungoverned brain an extravagant image of herself; an image wrapped in
      veils of somewhat tarnished but certainly boyish innocence,
      sentimentalized, curiously less interesting than the complicated
      wickedness and intrigue of actual human life as it presented itself to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he tried to kiss her she left him. But lingered to listen to his
      proposal that she should follow him to his own cabin; smiled enigmatically
      in the dusk beneath the deck light; humming lightly, pleasingly, she moved
      away; turned to watch him bolting for his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She strolled around the deck then. Apparently none other was sitting out.
      The teachers and the young men were spending the evening, she knew, with
      Dawley Kane at the consulate. Rocky had got out of that. Tex Connor was in
      his cabin; reading, doubtless, with his one good eye. For rough as he
      might be, this gambler and promoter of boxing and wrestling reveled
      secretly in love stories. He read them by the hundred, the old-fashioned
      paper-covered romances and tales of adventure. A pretty able man. Tex;
      useful in certain sorts of undertakings; certainly useful now; but with
      that curious romantic strain&mdash;a weakness, she felt. And a difficult
      man, strong, arrogant, leaning on crude power and threats where she leaned
      on delicately adjusted intrigue. Had Tex known better how to cover his
      various trails he would be in New York or London now, not out here on the
      coast picking up small change. Approaching him would be a bit of a
      problem; for a year or so their ways, hers and his, had lain far apart. It
      was not known, here on the boat, that they were so much as casually
      acquainted. They bowed at the dining table; nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Manila Kid was in the social hall, rummaging through the shelf of
      battered and scratched records above the taking machine. A quaint spirit,
      the Kid; weak, oddly useless, gloomily devoted to music of a simple sort,
      quite without enterprise. But.... by this time the delicate steel
      machinery of her mind was functioning clearly.... he would serve now, if
      only as a means of solving that first little problem of interesting Tex.
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused in the doorway; caught his furtive eye, and with a slight
      beckoning movement of her head, moved back into the comparative darkness.
      Slowly&mdash;thick-headedly of course&mdash;he came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I'm wondering if you and Tex wouldn't like to pick up a
      little money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think we are?&rdquo; he replied in a guarded sulky voice. &ldquo;Tex
      dropped three thousand at that fight. There's no talking to him. He's
      rough&mdash;that's what he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim&mdash;&rdquo; she considered the man before her deliberately; his lank
      spineless figure, his characterless, hatchet face: &ldquo;Jim, send Tex to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I, Dix? Answer me that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't act up, Jim. I've never handed you anything that wasn't more than
      coming to you. I know all about you, Jim. Everything! I'm not talking&mdash;but
      I know. This is a big proposition I've got in mind, and you'll get your
      share, if you come in and stick with me? How about half a million in
      jewels?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know's Tex would care to go in for anything like that. If it's a
      yegg job&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not a yegg,&rdquo; she replied crisply. &ldquo;Ask Tex to slip around here. I
      don't want to talk on that side of the deck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you wouldn't like young Kane to know what you are&mdash;er?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sort of talk won't get you anywhere, Jim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;I've got eyes, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better learn how to use them. You hurry around to Tex's cabin. We may
      have to move quickly.&rdquo; Sulkily the Kid went; and shortly returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;this after a silence&mdash;&ldquo;what did he say? Is he coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wants you to go around there&mdash;to his stateroom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't do that. He's got to come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This decision lightened somewhat the gloom on the Kid's saturnine
      countenance. He went again, more briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl slipped into her own cabin and consulted a folding map of China
      she had there. Huang Chau&mdash;she measured roughly from the scale with
      her thumb&mdash;would be seventy or eighty miles up-stream from Kiu Kiang
      here, perhaps thirty-five down-stream from Hankow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tex was chewing a cigar by the rail. At her step his round impassive face
      turned toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said, &ldquo;Hello, Tex!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He replied, his one eye fixed on her: &ldquo;Well, what is this job?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Tex&mdash;are you game for a big one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The revolution's broken out at Hankow&mdash;or across at Wu Chang&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's going to be another big battle near Hankow. The republicans are
      moving over. Sure to be a mix-up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There'll be loot&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait! I know where there's a collection of jewels&mdash;diamonds, pearls,
      rubies, emeralds&mdash;all kinds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know how to get it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It's a big thing. We'd be selling stones for years in America and
      Europe, Will you go in with me, fifty-fifty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the risk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much&mdash;with things so confused. Looks to me like one of those
      chances that just happens once in a hundred years. Take some imagination
      and nerve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is this stuff?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you when we get there. You'll have to trust me about that. I've
      never lied to you, and you have lied to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen! Here's the idea. There's a lot of nervous soldiers on this boat
      that wouldn't mind a little loot on their own. Here's your boxer&mdash;what's
      his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom Sung.&rdquo; Connor's eye never left her face; and she, on her part, never
      flinched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To those soldiers he's the biggest man on earth. <i>He</i> wouldn't mind
      a little clean-up either. Oh, there's enough, Tex&mdash;plenty! You see
      what I'm getting at. With your Tom for a leader you can pick up a few of
      those soldiers, enough to get away clean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they're shooting 'em!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They shot two. They'd have trouble shooting forty. Make Tom do the work&mdash;right
      now, to-night, while we're lying up here. They'll follow him; and you
      won't have to stand back of him if he's caught. He'll just be one of the
      rebels then. Get this right, Tex! It's a real chance. You'll never get
      another like it. With the soldiers we can get a launch&mdash;hire it,
      even, if you want to play safe&mdash;and go right up there and get the
      stuff. Nobody'll ever know it wasn't just a case of soldiers on the
      loose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How're you going to get away? They'd know we weren't here, wouldn't
      they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't try to tell me we couldn't slip out of China, if we had to. This
      isn't England or America. I don't believe we'd even have to. Just a case
      of playing it right&mdash;using your head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is this place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's there, and I'll take you to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have to tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quietly she moved her head in the negative. He would hardly know that the
      viceroy was not going on through to Hankow and Peking; she had the
      information herself only from Rocky Kane. Nor would he know, by any
      chance, the situation of his excellency's ancestral home. For Tex was not
      what they termed a &ldquo;sinologue&rdquo;; he knew white men and women and yellow
      servants, the steamers and railways, the gambling clubs and race tracks;
      little else. There was then, little reason why he should think of the
      viceroy at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's anything from a million or two up, Tex,&rdquo; she said coolly. &ldquo;And my
      information comes straight. I'll prove it by taking the chance with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head; half turned. &ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; She smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left her abruptly then. And coolly she watched him go. It would take a
      little time for Tex's imagination to rise to it; and until the last moment
      he would try to bluff her down. It was just poker; they had played that
      game before, she and Tex. Once he had robbed her. But not this time&mdash;not,
      as she phrased it, if she saw him first.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Kid came edging out of the social hall. &ldquo;Will he do it?&rdquo; he whispered
      hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says he won't,&rdquo; replied Dixie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say&mdash;that's tough! I didn't think Tex would overlook a thing like
      that. What's the matter?&rdquo; Dixie now considered this curiously useless man.
      Or useless he had always seemed to her. Now she was not so sure. &ldquo;He makes
      it a condition that I tell him where the stuff is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;Dix, you'd tell him that, wouldn't you?&rdquo; The Kid was whining.
      &ldquo;If you really knew yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I won't tell him, Jim. Not yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes sank before hers. He fumbled in a pocket; produced a tiny wrist
      watch of platinum. &ldquo;Look here. Dix,&rdquo; he remarked clumsily, &ldquo;things ain't
      always been's pleasant as they might be between you and I, but I was
      wondering if you wouldn't put this on, for old times' sake, like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took the gift, weighed in in her hand. &ldquo;Thank you, Jim,&rdquo; she replied.
      &ldquo;That's awfully nice of you. Though perhaps I'd better not wear it here on
      the boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose young Kane might ask questions, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing like that. I'll wear it. Here&mdash;you snap the catch, Jim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I might wish it on, Dix, like the kids do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Have you wished?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, Say, Dix, you won't mind the little place where the initials got
      scratched off inside the back cover. Nobody'll see that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely not,&rdquo; said Dixie.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a little after midnight Griggsby Doane mounted to the boat deck and
      walked quietly aft past the funnels and the engine room ventilators. A
      half moon threw shadows along the bund and among the landing hulks and the
      moored silent sampans, lorchas, junks. The mile-wide river shimmered in a
      million ripples.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight figure rose from a skylight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hui Fei wore the black jacket and trousers of the lower class Chinese
      women below decks. Her head was uncovered, and her hair waved prettily
      down across the wide forehead. She should have oiled it flat, of course,
      to complete her disguise; this careless arrangement was charming in the
      moonlight but was neither Manchu nor Chinese.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane found himself holding her small hand and looking gravely down at
      her. He even slowly shook his head. &ldquo;You must tell me quickly what you
      have to say, Miss Hui. As soon as possible you must go back. This is very
      unsafe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It will not be long. It is ver' har' to say. But I
      am so alone. There is no one to tell me what I mus' do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She plunged bravely into her story. Her information had come from one or
      another of her maids. And she had overheard gossip among the mandarins.
      The throne had sent her father the silken cord. She could not discover
      why. To be sure they called him a secondary devil, meaning one who
      sympathised with the foreigners. The reactionary Manchus at Peking,
      reveling and plotting within the sacred walls of the Forbidden City,
      remembered nothing, it appeared, of the recent past. The eunuchs, always
      the stormy petrels of China's darkest days, were again in power at the
      palace; the great empress dowager, she whom all China termed,
      half-affectionately, &ldquo;the Old Buddha,&rdquo; had given them their head, and now
      this new young empress with all the arrogance of the Old Buddha and none
      of her genius for power or her profound experience, was running wild. And
      as a consequence, Kang Yu, the statesman who more than any other was
      equipped to counsel her wisely during this stormy time, was returning to
      the home of his ancestors to die by his own hand. It would be said at the
      Forbidden City that a gracious empress dowager had &ldquo;permitted&rdquo; him to
      go.... Doane's disturbed thoughts darted back over the bloodstained recent
      history of Manchu officialdom. The Old Buddha had &ldquo;permitted&rdquo; Ch'i Ying,
      late Manchu Viceroy of Canton, to slay himself; and had graciously
      extended the same privilege to others after the Boxer trouble of the year
      1900, among them an acquaintance of Doane's, Chao Shu-ch'iao. Others she
      had decapitated&mdash;Yuan Ch'ang, Li Shan, Controller of the Household,
      and Hsu Ching, President of the Board of War. She killed, too, Hsu
      Ching-Ch'eng, who, like Kang, had held the post of minister in more than
      one of the capitals of Europe. The only known charge against this Hsu was
      that he had come to admire foreign customs.

      In her narrative the girl spoke only English. Her voice was deep in
      quality, without heaviness; musical, like most voices among the
      better-to-do in the Middle Kingdom, Chinese and Manchu alike. And, colored
      now with deep emotion, it had an appealing quality to which Doane found a
      response&mdash;difficult, at the moment, to repress&mdash;among his own
      emotions. He sensed, too, with a pleasure that was, in his lonely life,
      stirring, the naiveté of her Western feeling. Standing here in simple
      native costume, in the heart of old China, gazing wistfully out over the
      tangled hundreds of sleeping junks and sampans, this girl, freshly out of
      a Massachusetts college, was pleading against hope that her father might
      be spared the final jealous vengeance of the mightiest remaining Oriental
      throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The China that Doane had so long known, that had, indeed, for better or
      worse, been woven into the fiber of his being, was turning suddenly
      incredible. He stared, more intently than he knew, straight down at the
      slim little figure&mdash;for beside his own huge frame this tall girl
      appeared as hardly more than a child&mdash;at the unadorned face that was
      softly girlish, at the Mack hair waving down over the pale forehead,
      glistening in the moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They mean to confisca'&rdquo;&mdash;she left off, in her eagerness to explain,
      the final <i>te</i>&mdash;&ldquo;all his property. Tell me, Mister Duane, can
      they do that&mdash;all his property?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He reflected. There would be vast areas of tea-lands and rice lands,
      almost innumerable shares in these new corporations, the famous
      collections of jades, paintings, carvings and jewels. Finally he inclined
      his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid they could. It would be an outrageous act, but the government
      now, I'm sorry to say, is in outrageous hands. If the empress is
      determined, as apparently she is, there are ways enough of getting at all
      his possessions. Even through the banks.&rdquo; His heart was full, his voice
      tender; but he could not deceive her. He added a question: &ldquo;Does his
      excellency, your father, know all this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;I have tol' him. But I can no' make him see it like me. Oh,
      we are so differen'. I am, you see, an American girl. I am free here,&rdquo; she
      laid a pretty hand on her breast. &ldquo;When I try to think of all these
      dreadful things&mdash;of these wicked eunuchs an' the empress who is like
      thousan' of years ago&mdash;blin', childish!&mdash;an' the people who can
      no' yet see it differen'&mdash;I get bewilder'. You un'erstan'. You are an
      American, too. I can speak with you. That is well, because there isn'
      anybody else I can speak with. An' my father admires you. If you will only
      speak with him&mdash;if you will only help me make him think differen'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane wondered what he could do, what she imagined he could do, without
      influence or money. He quite forgot, in this matter of influence alone,
      the significance of the viceroy's courtesy, as of Sun Shi-pi's appeal to
      him. For a little too long he had been a beaten man. It was becoming
      dangerously near a habit so to consider himself. And now, to make active
      clear thinking impossible, emotion flooded his brain. Gently he asked her
      what she would have him do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father will no' listen when I speak, He is ver' kind, ver' generous.
      He has made me an American girl. That is one of the things they say is
      wrong. Even for tha' they attack his good name. But when I ask Him no' to
      do this, no' to die so wrongly, he speaks to me like an ol' Manchu of long
      ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is between the worlds,&rdquo; mused Doane, aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is that. An' I, perhaps, am between the worl's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he mus' no' do it! It is so simple! The throne will no' live. Not one
      year more. I know that. They are fighting now at Wu Chang.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane inclined his head. &ldquo;I know that, Miss Hui, but the revolution has
      not yet gone so far that success is sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is sure. The people will everywhere rise. I know it&mdash;here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my hope, too. But to stir this great land means so much in effort
      and education. You have changed, yes. Your father has changed. Sun Yat Sen
      was educated in a medical school and has lived in America and England; he
      has changed. But all China&mdash;I do not want to dash your hopes, dear
      Miss Hui, but I fear China is not nearly so far along as you and I would
      wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;even so&mdash;mus' my father die because a wicked empress has
      no brains? It is no' right. Listen, please! If you, Mis'er Doane, would
      jus' try to persua' my father! He will listen to you. Oh, if you woul'
      stay with us, an' help us. We coul' take some money, some jewels, an'
      escape down the river&mdash;to Shanghai&mdash;to Japan, or even America.
      My father mus' no' die like this. There will be a few servan's we can
      trus'. You speak to my father, sir, an' he will listen. I know that. He
      says you have the mind of the ol' philosopher&mdash;of Lao-tze himself. He
      said that. An' you have the Western strength that he admires. An' he says
      you un'erstan' China. Oh, will you speak to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane stared out into the luminous night. This response in his breast to
      her eager youth frightened him now. He had felt of late that life mattered
      little; certainly not his own. But youth, and hope, and faith&mdash;they
      mattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her small hand in his own. His heart was beating high. It was
      going to be hard now, to control his voice. He was, then, after all the
      years, the struggles, the beatings, incurably romantic....
    </p>
    <p>
      Stirred yet by the vibrant pulse of youth that in some men and women never
      dies. He himself had thought this negative spirit of the past few years a
      philosophy, but apparently, it was nothing of the sort. Or where was it
      now? For he was suddenly all nervously alive, a man of vigor and pride, a
      man of urgent emotional need....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will try,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She clung to his hand. &ldquo;I have your promise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed. &ldquo;I must think. I should not like to fail. There will be time. He
      will&rdquo;&mdash;it was hard to phrase this&mdash;&ldquo;he will wait, surely, until
      he is at home. But you must not stay longer here. And we must not meet
      again like this. I will try my best to help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed a pitifully inadequate speech. But the wild impulse was upon him
      to clasp her lovely person in his arms&mdash;claim her, fight for her,
      live again a man's life through and for her. It was, he deliberately
      thought, almost insane in him. A man with nothing to offer, not even the
      great hope of youth, struggling against an emotion, a hunger, that it was
      grotesque to indulge. He compressed his lips tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed breathless. For a moment she pressed her hands to her cheeks
      and eyes; then waved to him and went lightly down the ladder.

      CHAPTER V&mdash;RESURGENCE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE upper-deck
      passengers awoke in the morning to find the engines still at rest, and the
      now familiar View of Kiu Kiang still to be seen from port-side windows;
      the <i>Yen Hsin</i> had merely been moved a hundred yards or so below the
      landing hulk and anchored. There was grumbling about the breakfast table.
      The captain did not appear. The huge mate was preoccupied; explaining with
      grave courtesy that he had no further news. He assumed that orders to
      proceed to Hankow would be forthcoming during the day. It was understood
      now that the republican troops were everywhere protecting white folk, and,
      in any event, the foreign concessions up the river were well guarded by
      the war-ships.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outstanding fact was that they were to spend at least another night on
      the river. The sensible thing to do, or so decided the younger men, was to
      have a dance. Accordingly, before tiffin, committees were hard at work
      planning decorations for the social hall. Miss Means proved a fertile
      source of entertaining ideas. And it was agreed, during the day, that Miss
      Andrews had a pretty taste at hanging flags.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chinese day begins with the light. And little Mr. Kato, sitting
      smilingly through breakfast, had already passed hours among his
      below-decks acquaintance. After breakfast he sat outside with the Kanes,
      senior and junior, talking rapidly. There Miss Carmichael observed them;
      later, when Rocky stood by the rail throwing brass cash down into the
      crowding, nosing sampans of the water beggars, she strolled his way&mdash;looking
      incredibly young&mdash;carrying a book from the boat's library, a thin
      finger between the pages as a mark. She smiled at the quarreling beggars
      below. But he, at sight of her, grew sulky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't come last night,&rdquo; he said, very low, his voice thick with
      suddenly rising feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I couldn't. You can't always plan things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rocky, please! You mustn't talk like that. We can be seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; he closed his lips. It was the first time she had called him
      by his name. That seemed something. And she was right; they must keep up
      appearances. He felt that she was extremely clever; living her own life as
      a business woman, away out here, doing as she chose, like a man, never
      losing her head for a moment. Well, he would show her that he could be a
      sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kato picked up some queer news this morning, prowling around. There's a
      mutiny brewing below decks. He hasn't got all the facts, yet. He's down
      there now. It's the viceroy's soldiers. First thing we know they'll be
      blowing up the boat.&rdquo; He was gloomy about it; boyishly turning his heavy
      burden of self-pity and reproach into the new channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;we'll all have to take our chances, I suppose,&rdquo; and
      moved away a step, pausing and balancing gracefully on the balls of her
      feet and smiling at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he muttered&mdash;&ldquo;don't go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's better. No good in our being seen too much together&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll save you some dances to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lot! All of them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled again at this outburst; said, &ldquo;We can visit afterward, anyhow,&rdquo;
       and moved away.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other side of the deck she found the Manila Kid leaning in a
      doorway, moodily chewing a match. His listless eyes at once sought her
      wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not wearing it,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know why, Jim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure! Young Kane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jim, where are your brains? Don't try to tell me that Tex hasn't seen
      that watch.... Well, do you want him to know there's something between us&mdash;just
      now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know's I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her pale cool eyes swept the deck. Then she leaned beside him; opened her
      book, then looked out over it at the shipping and the dimpling river
      beyond; smiled in her easy way. &ldquo;Jim, why didn't you tell me that Tex has
      started this thing without me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been watching for a chance to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She considered this. He went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Dixie, this is big stuff!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been trying to figure out how we stand. I didn't quite get you last
      night. Tex and his boy Tom have got a bunch of the soldiers now. But
      they're moving careful because there's another show been started. One of
      the regular revolutionary crowd is below there stirring 'em up. Some of
      'em are full of this republic idea, want to die for it and all that stuff,
      and Tex has to move cautious to buy 'em off. Say, what does he want so
      many for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The more the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how're you going to pay 'em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them loot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Tex&mdash;and Tom&mdash;are promising them part of the real stuff,
      jewels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you'd probably have to promise. But when they get into it, with
      plenty of loot and liquor and women, it'll be easy enough to get away from
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how're you going to keep 'em in hand before that? Do you know what
      some of 'em are whispering around now? They want to carve up the boat.
      Come right up here and go through the viceroy's outfit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he hasn't much stuff here, Jim. We've got bigger game than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know&mdash;and anyway it'd bring a gunboat down on us. That's what Tex
      is trying to make Tom see. Tom's in Tex's room now. But my God, Dixie,
      when I think of what you've started in that offhand way o' yours....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tex'll hold them down, Jim. That's one good thing about him, he's not
      weak. You're nervous. Better go in and help the teachers hang flags.
      That'll soothe you. You and I mustn't talk any more either. If there's any
      news for me, better send me a chit by a boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Kid looked mournfully at her. He was a grotesque, this Jim Watson,
      tall, angular, thin bony face under the tipped-back cap, bald salients
      running up into his hair on either side the plastered-down front locks.
      And as he gazed on this wisp of a girl who had slipped mysteriously in
      among the adroit swindlers and adventuresses of the coast but a few brief
      years back and had from the very beginning cleverly made her way, his
      disorganized spirit yearned toward her. She had brains, and used them. She
      knew how to be nice to a fellow, and the Kid hungered for sympathy. And
      she was piquantly desirable: in part because men sought her without
      success. Except perhaps that young naval officer at Hong Kong, the name of
      no man had been seriously linked with hers; and the fact that he was an
      eldest son of one of the richest and greatest families in England in a
      measure removed the incident beyond the confines of normal human
      experience. No, the Kid could hardly feel that he ought to resent that. He
      knew, as he so moodily surveyed her, that her sympathy&mdash;the word was
      his own&mdash;could be bought only at a high price. The price, indeed,
      frightened him. He couldn't think along with Dixie and Tex. Nor could he
      easily conceive of opposing Tex, for the man was strong and merciless.
      Still....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Dixie, if I wasn't so fool crazy over you, do you think for a
      minute I'd let you drag me into this kind of a mix-up? Why, my God!&mdash;when
      I got to thinking about it last night&mdash;the risks you're running&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's big stakes, Jim. You can't expect a million to fall into your lap.
      Got to play for it. Tell me&mdash;does this Tom Sung understand English?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course! He was a farm laborer in California, and a cook in the United
      States Navy. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may have to talk to him myself before we get through with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you know Tex means to rob you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said she, smiling a little for the benefit of a customs man
      who appeared up forward. &ldquo;You run along now, Jim. This is no game for weak
      nerves. Remember, I need you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;just this&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Careful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;You listen, now! You won't find me getting-cold feet&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I ain't afraid o' Tex Connor, either! If you mean that I've got to go
      up against him&mdash;Well, say, look here! If I go through&mdash;if I do
      everything you say&mdash;how're we going to stand, you and me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I let you give me the watch, didn't I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;that's all right&mdash;but I asked you once to go to the
      Islands with me, and you wouldn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not over there. I know too many people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, somewhere else, then! Tell me straight, now! If we pull this off&mdash;shake
      down a real pile&mdash;will you go with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked thoughtfully at him for a brief moment; then turned again to
      the river. &ldquo;You know I'm fond of you, Jim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a trade, Dixie? If I stick to you, you'll stick to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She considered this; finally, very quietly, barely parting her lips,
      replied, simply: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew in his breath with a whistling sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      She added, then: &ldquo;Careful, Jim! I know how you feel, but don't let
      yourself talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, Dix, but my God! When I think of how you've kept me dancing this
      year&mdash;and now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll say this, Jim. Just this. If you knew everything about Tex Connor&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean, he's tried to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean certain things he's said to me. If you're as fond of me as that
      you'd understand why I've felt, once or twice, like killing him. That man
      is a devil, Jim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she slipped away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Carmichael sat deliberately through tiffin; discreetly quiet, as
      always; apparently without nerves. The Kid ate rapidly, speaking not a
      word, seldom looking up from his plate. Tex Connor was calmly wooden, as
      always, though at intervals Miss Carmichael felt his eye on her as she
      daintily nibbled her curry.
    </p>
    <p>
      After tiffin she was stretched comfortably in her deck chair, reading, or
      seeming to, when Connor appeared, strolling along the deck, hands deep in
      pockets, chewing the inevitable Manila cigar. He wore a neat cap, and his
      large person was clothed in an outing suit of gray flannel. On his feet
      were shoes of whitened leather with rubber soles. To any but a shrewd
      student of physiognomy he might have passed for a prosperous American
      business man or politician, of the bluff western sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused at her careless nod; bent his face around and stared coldly at
      her. Nothing of the real man showed; even his rough vulgarity was
      concealed behind the mask and the manner. He ought to have a woman to tell
      him, she thought, that he was altogether too stout to wear a Norfolk
      jacket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dropped into the chair beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks as if we'd be hung up here till night anyhow,&rdquo; he said gruffly.
      &ldquo;All foolishness, too. It's safe enough between here and Hankow. The
      Jardine boat came down this morning. And we land at the concessions&mdash;don't
      have to go clear up to the city.&rdquo; He drummed on the chair; shifted his
      cigar. &ldquo;I can't hang around here. Got to get up to Peking before they
      close off the railroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She listened quietly to this little tirade; then remarked: &ldquo;Thought over
      my proposition, Tex?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What proposition?.... Oh, that scheme? Sure, I've thought it over.
      Nothing in it, Dix.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too complicated. Did you ever see a lot of soldiers on the loose&mdash;their
      killing blood up? You could never handle 'em in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;if you tried any coarse work. But I wouldn't
      pin that on you, Tex.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's easy to talk.&rdquo; Connor's voice rose slightly; he noted the fact
      himself; paused and spoke with greater deliberation. &ldquo;But I wouldn't
      tackle a gamelike that. It ain't practical. Anyhow, Dix, I wouldn't go it
      blind. I'd have to know where I was going every minute. If you wanted to
      talk real business, it might be different. I might see a way to start
      something. But even at that&rdquo;&mdash;he got heavily to his feet...."No,
      thing for me's to stick to my own line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was moving slowly away when her slow light voice brought him up short.
      &ldquo;Tex,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I see you're just a cheap liar, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she watched the color sweep over his face. It was something to stir
      that wooden countenance with genuine emotion. She even found a perverse
      thrill in the experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood motionless for a long moment. Finally he said, none too steadily:
      &ldquo;You know what would happen to a man that said that to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you do? Shoot?.... Where would that get you? No, Tex, listen!
      Sit down here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he stood over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know everything you're doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're crossing me. But you can't get away with it. You know where you
      are&mdash;in China! And you're tampering with the troops of the viceroy of
      Nanking. My God, Tex, haven't you <i>any</i> brains? Did you really think
      I'd show my hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He chewed the cigar in silence, staring down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll give you your choice,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;You can work with me.
      fifty-fifty, or I'll have Tom Sung beheaded. And then you'll be out a meal
      ticket. And all your expenses with Tom up to now. And the three thousand
      you lost to the Kanes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know what you're talking about! I haven't even seen Tom Sung in
      twenty-four hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's another lie. He was in your room this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that? Say, if Jim Watson's been talking....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hasn't, Tex. I've got my information&mdash;and there's a lot of if&mdash;from
      Kato the Japanese. Go and talk to him, if you like. Or to your friends the
      Kanes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connor, the color gone from his face now, looked steadily down at her.
      Slowly he drew from an inner pocket a gold-mounted case of alligator skin
      and selected a fresh cigar, lighting it on the stump of the old one.
      Finally he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dix, I'm taking some rough talk from you. But never mind&mdash;now. You
      say you know where the stuff is, but you won't tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now. I'll keep that information to trade with, Tex.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well and good. I'll tell you that you can't get it without a little help
      from me. And you're not going to get it. Tell me where it is, and I'll put
      it through and split with you. It'll have to be pretty quick, too. If you
      won't, you don't get your loot. And you give up my boy Tom&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What'll you do, Tex?&rdquo; She was faintly smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I won't shoot you. I'll protect myself better'n that. But I'll run
      you off the coast. You'll have turned your last card out here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this she said simply nothing. For a moment her two eyes met his one
      full. Then he strolled away. And the day passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane stood by the rail in the dusk of early evening looking in through
      the open doorway. The social hall was gay with flags, the dragon of China
      hung flat over the talking machine with the American and British colors
      draped on either hand. The little teachers had on their brightest and
      best. Miss Andrews in particular, wore a pink party gown that might have
      been made by a village dressmaker&mdash;or, more likely, by herself&mdash;and
      flushed prettily as she chatted with young Braker. The men were all in
      their dinner coats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dixie Carmichael, in the inevitable blue middy blouse, sat quietly reading
      in a corner. A strange creature, always imperturbably girlish. Duane had
      observed her casually on the boat and about the Astor House at Shanghai,
      and despite the curious tales that drifted along the coast&mdash;already
      the girl had acquired an almost legendary fame&mdash;he had never seen her
      other than discreetly quiet. Men who had observed her on the steamer from
      Hong Kong after the outraged British wives as good as drummed her out of
      town asserted that she exhibited not so much as a ruffle of the nerves. A
      girl without emotion, apparently; certainly without a moral sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had for a time managed a gambling house on Bubbling Well Road,
      Shanghai, but this year seemed to be more active up Peking way. At least
      she had made several trips to the north. There were moments when her thin,
      nearly expressionless face bore a look of infinite age; yet she was young.
      It would be interesting, he reflected, to know of her home and her youth,
      of the remarkable deficiency (or the equally remarkable gift) that had
      sent her out alone, with her hair down her back, to pit her uncanny
      quickness of thought and her sordid purpose against the desperately clever
      rascals of the coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      When again he passed the doorway they were dancing&mdash;a waltz. Dixie
      and young Kane were together. Miss Means, primmer than ever, moved about
      with a tall Australian. Braker was with little Miss Andrews. The others of
      the younger men danced humorously with one another. The Manila Kid stood
      lankily, gloomily, by the talking machine, sorting records.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a bustling outside the farther door; musical voices; the
      shimmering of satin in the light; and the viceroy came in, escorting his
      daughter and attended by all his suite. At the sight of Miss Hui Fei as
      she appeared in the doorway and stepped lightly over the sill Doane caught
      his breath. She wore an American costume, a gown of soft material in rose
      color trimmed with silver, the stockings and little slippers in silver as
      well. A girl at any college or suburban dance back home might have dressed
      like that. Her richly black hair was parted on the side; masses of it
      waved carelessly down over her temples and part of the broad forehead. Her
      color was high, her eyes were bright. The eagerly Western quality he had
      sensed in her was dominant now, triumphant as youth can be triumphant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane, for a moment, pressed a hand to his eyes. He could not relate this
      radiantly Western girl with the quaintly Oriental figure he had last seen
      by moonlight on the boat deck. It was difficult, too, to understand her
      bright happiness. Had her insistently modern spirit prevailed over her
      father's resolve to die? Or was she, after all, carried away by girlishly
      high spirits at the thought of a party? On the latter possibility Doane
      set his teeth; it raided thoughts of Oriental fatalism and surface
      adaptability that he could not face. Surely the girl who had talked so
      earnestly, who had so clearly exhibited a Western view of her father's
      predicament, was more than Oriental at heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most deeply sobering thought, of course, was that he should so
      poignantly care. The mere sight of her thrilled him, shook him. All night
      and during this day he had been fighting the new shining sense of her in
      his heart; it was clear now that the battle was a losing one. It was true,
      then; the last broken shards of his elaborately built up, wholly mental
      philosophy of life had crashed hopelessly about his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pity of it seemed to him, even then, to be that he was possessed of
      such abounding vitality of body and mind. He felt a young man. He was
      never ill, never even tired. Only accident, he felt, could shorten his
      life. Certainly he wouldn't take it himself; he had gone all through that.
      He would have to go dully on and on; he was like an engine that is using
      but a fraction of its proper power. He had not known that his need was a
      woman until he met this woman. To no other, he felt, could he give the
      rich upwellings of emotion in his heart; and vital emotion, he had
      tragically learned three years earlier, can not be repressed indefinitely.
      There was a breaking point... He was, even now, bringing up favorable
      arguments. This young woman, as she had admitted, like himself, stood
      between the worlds. She could never be happy in China; hardly out of it.
      If.... If.... Thoughts came, bitter thoughts, of his years, of his
      poverty. The thing had the grip of a demoniac possession. He had seen
      other men mad over the one woman, and had pitied them; but now he.... He
      called himself savagely, in his heart, a fool. Yet the wild hopes mounted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waltz was over. The Kid changed the records and ground the machine. An
      interpreter left the group of mandarins and spoke with one of the
      Australians; led the man back to his excellency. A moment later the music
      sounded again, and the Australian danced lightly away with Miss Hui Fei in
      what Doane had no means of knowing was the very new one-step. He had never
      danced; plainly she loved it. She moved like a fairy&mdash;light, utterly
      graceful, her oval face, when she turned, flushed a little and soberly
      radiant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hating the man who held her so close, he turned away. He did not know that
      his excellency, glimpsing him outside there in the shadows, leaned forward
      and bowed; he did not observe (or care) that Dixie Carmichael was dancing
      with the German customs man, while Rocky Kane, suddenly white, lighting
      one cigarette on another, stood in a corner devouring with his eyes Miss
      Hui Fei. A little later, when the young man spoke, there at his side, he
      started; for he had heard no one approach. Rocky was hatless; hair rumpled
      as if he had been running nervous fingers through it, cheeks deeply
      flushed, eyes staring rather wildly. He threw his cigarette overboard and
      squarely faced the huge man in blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what you'll think of me&mdash;&rdquo; he began, in a breathless,
      unsteady voice; then his eyes wavered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane turned with him, Dixie Carmichael stood in the doorway, watching
      them. Rocky, with a nervous gesture, as if he would brush her away, looked
      up again into the stern older face. He was plainly lost in himself,
      burning with the confused fires of youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what you'll think of me&mdash;&rdquo; he came again to a stop.
      Apparently the words, &ldquo;Mr. Doane,&rdquo; would have completed the sentence, but
      failed for some reason to find voice. Perhaps it was the habit of his
      wealthy environment that restrained him even now from speaking with more
      than casual respect to a uniformed employee of a river line; yet,
      contradictorily, here he was, all boyish humility!.... &ldquo;I'm a damn fool,
      of course, I know that. But&mdash;you've seen her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane glanced again toward the door. Dixie Carmichael had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;not that one!&rdquo; cried the boy hotly; then dropped his voice. &ldquo;The
      girl in there! The&mdash;princess, isn't she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane inclined his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she'd be the one I&mdash;well, you remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's the same. The Princess Hui Fei&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hughie Fay? Like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a lovely name!.... You&mdash;I know you won't understand! It's so
      hard to&mdash;I <i>am</i> young, of course. I've been sort of in wrong. I
      guess you think I'm a pretty wild lot. I seem to have been trying about
      everything. But until to-night&mdash;oh, there's no use pretending I'm not
      hit all of a heap. I am. I never saw anything like her&mdash;never in my
      life. I don't know what the pater would say&mdash;me falling for a Manchu
      girl&mdash;you think I'm crazy, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I am. My head's racing. Just watching her in there makes my pulse
      jump. I get bewildered. Tell me&mdash;she was all Chinese the&mdash;the
      other time&mdash;all painted up. Big head-dress with flowers on it. Why
      did she do that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of respect to her father. The rouge and the head-dress were according
      to Oriental custom.&rdquo; He looked directly down at the boy, and added,
      deliberately, &ldquo;Veneration of parents is the finest thing in Chinese life.
      I sometimes think we have nothing so fine in America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy's eyes fell. He mumbled. &ldquo;Ouch! You landed there, I guess.&rdquo; Then
      he raised his eyes. &ldquo;I can't help myself&mdash;whatever I am&mdash;but I
      can start fresh, can't I? That's what I'm going to do, anyhow&mdash;start
      fresh.&rdquo; He squared himself. His lip quivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you take me in there to the viceroy, and translate my apology?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane stood a moment in silence. Then he replied, quietly, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; And led
      the way into the social hall. He found himself watching, like a spectator,
      the little scene.... the viceroy rising, with a quiet smile, a gentle old
      man, awaiting with perfect courtesy of bearing whatever might be
      forthcoming; Rocky Kane, seeming younger than before, with, in fact, the
      appearance of an excited boy, the wild look still in his eyes but the face
      set with supreme determination. Doane observed now that he had a good
      forehead, wide and not too high. The nose was slightly aquiline, like his
      father's. The eyes, so dark now, were normally blue; the mouth sensitive;
      the skin fine in texture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him&rdquo;&mdash;thus the boy&mdash;&ldquo;tell him I acted like a dirty cad,
      that I know better, and&mdash;and ask his pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane translated discreetly. A dance was just ending, and curious eyes
      were bent on the group. The mandarins stood behind the viceroy, all
      gracefully at ease in their rich rubes.
    </p>
    <p>
      His excellency, without relaxing that smile, replied in musical
      intonation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Rocky Kane, under his breath, all quivering
      excitement; &ldquo;what does he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he accepts your apology, with appreciation of your manliness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Kane's nervous frown relaxed at this. He was pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you,&rdquo; he was saying now, &ldquo;will you ask if I may dance with the
      princess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane complied. He felt now a strain of fineness in this ungoverned boy
      that was oddly moving to his own emotion-clouded brain.... Hoi Fei was
      approaching, the Australian at her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He suggests&rdquo;&mdash;Doane found himself translating&mdash;&ldquo;that you ask
      her. He does not know what engagements she may have made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy bit his lip. And then the princess was greeting the mate. &ldquo;It's
      nice to see you, Mr. Doane,&rdquo; she was saying. &ldquo;I wondered if you weren't
      coming to the party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Doane that he could feel young Kane's devouring eyes fastened
      on her. The moment had come in which he must act. The Australian, sensing
      a situation, thanked the princess and slipped away. Quietly, Doane said:
      &ldquo;Miss Hui Fei, this is Mr. Kane, who has asked permission to meet you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew back a very little; Doane caught that; yet the courtesy of her
      race did not fail her. She inclined her pretty head; even smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should I speak English?&rdquo; asked the boy, out of sheer confusion; then:
      &ldquo;Miss Hui Fei&rdquo;&mdash;he was white; the words came slowly, almost coldly,
      between set teeth&mdash;&ldquo;I am sorry for my rotten behavior the other
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was all. He waited. Miss Hui's smile faded.
    </p>
    <p>
      No Oriental could have come out so bluntly with it. She seemed to be
      considering him. Gradually the smile returned, and with it an air of
      courteous dismissal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have forgotten it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kane gathered his courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I have a dance with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment the silence was marked. Perhaps Miss Hui was gathering
      herself as well. But it was only a moment; she spoke, smiling as if she
      were happy, her manner gracious, even kind: &ldquo;I am sorry. I have promise'
      every dance. The ladies are so few to-nigh'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was all. The boy seemed somewhat slow in comprehending it. He stood
      motionless; then the color returned slowly to his face, flooding it. He
      bowed to her stiffly, then to her father, and rushed out on deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Hui smiled up at the mate. &ldquo;I have save' the dance you ask',&rdquo; she
      said pleasantly. &ldquo;It is this nex' one, if you don' mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Manila Kid adjusted the needle and released the catch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry,&rdquo; said Doane, as they moved away, &ldquo;I don't dance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The commonplace remark fell strangely on his own ears. It could hardly be
      himself speaking. He was all glowingly warm with impulse, his logic gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll sit it out,&rdquo; said Miss Hui pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And during the brief walk across the room, beside this buoyantly graceful
      girl, even while aware of the eyes upon him, he felt the magic wine of
      youth thrilling through his arteries. What a fairy she was! Snatches of
      poetry came; one&mdash;=
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Were it ever so airy a tread...."=
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;and lingered fragrantly after they were seated and he found himself
      looking down at her, listening with something of the gravity and
      kindliness of long habit when she so quickly spoke.

      CHAPTER VI&mdash;CONFLAGRATION
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> BEWILDERED,
      crushed Rocky Kane stood tightly holding the rail; staring down at the
      softly black water that ran so smoothly along the hull beneath; muttering
      in whispers that at intervals broke out into heated speech. This strange
      princess had humiliated him perfectly, completely; there had been nothing
      he could say, nothing to do but go; and she had let him go without a look
      or a further thought. He told himself it was unfair. He had swallowed his
      pride and apologized. Could a man do more?
    </p>
    <p>
      But pressing upward through this chaotic mental surface of hurt pride and
      insistent self-justification came an equally insistent memory of his
      outrageous conduct toward her. As the moments passed, the memory
      intensified into a painfully vivid picture. His native intelligence,
      together with the undeveloped decency that was somewhere within him, kept
      at him with dart-like, stinging thoughts. He had insulted not only herself
      but her race as well, in assuming a ruthless right to make free with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then self-justification again; how could he know that she spoke English
      and dressed like the girls back home? Was it fair of her to masquerade
      like that?
    </p>
    <p>
      He was miserably wrong, of course. And his nerves were terribly upset.
      That was at least part of the trouble, his nerves; he lighted a cigarette
      to steady them. The match shook in his hand. This nervous trembling had
      been increasing lately; he found it an alarming symptom. Perhaps the
      trouble was inherent weakness. Ability like his father's often skipped a
      generation; and character. Yes, he was weak, he had failed at everything.
      His college career was a wreck; a monstrous wreck, he believed, echoes
      from which would follow him through life. To his incoherent mind it seemed
      that he had about all the vices&mdash;drinking, gambling, pursuing
      helpless girls, even smoking opium. His one faith had been money; but now
      he suddenly, wretchedly, knew that even the money might fail him. It was
      as easy to toss away a million as a hundred on the red or the black. And
      then young men who wasted themselves acquired diseases from the terrors of
      which no fortune could promise release; a thought that had long dwelt
      uncomfortably in a sensitive, deep-shadowed corner of his brain.... a
      brain that was racing now, beyond control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her unfairness lay in so publicly snubbing him. Her father knew the facts,
      as did Miss Carmichael, and the big mate, that old preacher with a
      mysterious past. Who was he, anyhow&mdash;setting up to regulate other
      people's lives?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then rose among these turbulent thoughts a picture of the princess as she
      was now, there in the social hall. Tears welled into his eyes; he brushed
      them away, lighted a fresh cigarette and deeply inhaled the smoke. He had
      rushed out; suddenly, wildly, he desired to rush back. She was beautiful.
      She had quaintly moving charm. A rare little lady! It seemed almost that
      he might compel her to listen while he explained. But what was it that he
      was to explain? That he was some other than the dirty sort they all knew
      him to be, that he had proved himself to be?
    </p>
    <p>
      The wild thoughts were like a beating in his brain. It was his father's
      fault, this crazy nervousness, and his mother's.... He hated that big
      mate. Self-pity rose like a tidal wave, and engulfed him. He stared and
      stared at the softly dark water. Beginning with about his sixteenth year
      he had wrestled often with the thought of suicide, as so many sensitive
      young men do. Now the water fascinated him; it was so still, it moved so
      resistlessly on to the sea. &ldquo;A pretty easy way to slip out. Just a little
      splash&mdash;-I could climb down. Nobody'd know. Nobody'd care much of a
      damn. Oh, the old man would think he cared, but he wouldn't. He'll never
      make a bank president out of me. And that's all he wants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A voice, guardedly friendly, said, &ldquo;Better not let yourself talk that
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned with a start. Miss Carmichael was standing there by the rail. So
      he had talked aloud&mdash;another unpleasant symptom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you saw what&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She inclined her head. &ldquo;What's the good of letting it upset you? Lie down
      for a while. A pipe or two wouldn't hurt you. You're nervous as a witch.
      It would soothe you.&rdquo; He stared at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better lie down anyway,&rdquo; she said, taking his arm and moving him toward
      his cabin. &ldquo;You don't want them to see you like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He yielded. His will was powerless. He dropped on the seat, while she
      lingered, almost sympathetically, in the doorway, an unbelievably girlish
      figure in the half light. Something of the influence she had been exerting
      on him&mdash;which had seemed to die when Miss Hui Fei entered the social
      hall&mdash;fluttered to life now. He found relief, abruptly, in
      recklessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on in,&rdquo; he said huskily. &ldquo;Have a pipe with me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quietly, wholly matter-of-fact, she closed and locked the door. &ldquo;We'll
      shut the window, too, this time,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't turn on the light.&rdquo; He was reaching for his trunk. &ldquo;Excuse me&mdash;a
      minute! I can see all right. I know just where everything is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave the trunk out,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;And lay your suit-case on it. Then we
      can put the lamp on that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Hui Fei led Doane to a seat under the curving front windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We mus' talk as if ever'thing were ver' pleasan'.&rdquo; The question rose
      again, but without bitterness now, how she could smile so brightly. &ldquo;I
      have learn' some more. It is ver' difficul' to tell you, but.... it is
      difficul' to think, even.... so strange that at firs' I laugh'.&rdquo;.... Yes,
      there were tears in her eyes. But how bravely she fought them back and
      smiled again. He felt his own eyes filling, and turned quickly to the
      window; but not so quickly that she failed to see. She was sensitively
      observant, despite her own trouble. For a moment, then, they were silent,
      lost in a deep common sympathy that was bread to his starving heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in that moment that their little conspiracy nearly broke down. Had
      any of the others in the big room looked just then, gossip would have
      spread swiftly; certainly sharp-eyed mandarins would have found matter for
      consideration; for Hui Fei impulsively found his hand as it rested between
      them on the seat, and was met with a quick warm pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, in another moment, she was speaking, quite herself. &ldquo;My maid has
      foun' out tha' they are sending the head eunuch from the Forbidden C'ty to
      our home. An' that is agains' the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Even the Old Buddha never tried but once to send
      out a eunuch on government business. That was the notorious An Te-hai. And
      he never returned; he was caught in Shantung&mdash;in a barge of state on
      the Grand Canal&mdash;and beheaded. Even the Old Buddha couldn't do that.
      This woman is amazing. But of course there is really no government at
      Peking now&mdash;only this strange anachronism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has orders to seize all father's beautifu' things the paintings an'
      stones an' carvings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rebels may catch him. They'd make short work of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask about that. The rebels have cross the river from Wu Chang to Han
      Yang, but they have not yet reach the railway. That comes into Hankow
      from this side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even so,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;the train service from Peking must have broken down.
      Though they're running troop trains south, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't tol' you all of it.&rdquo; Her voice was low and unsteady. &ldquo;This
      eunuch, Chang Yuan-fu, is ordered, by the empress, to take me to Peking
      too. They are all whispering about it. The empress is angry at my foreign
      ways, and will marry me to a Manchu duke. She di'n' like it when my father
      tol' her I mus' marry no man I di'n' choose myself.... I think you ough'
      to smile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mechanically he obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems almos' funny.&rdquo; murmured Miss Hui. &ldquo;Sometimes I can no' believe
      tha' such a thing could happen. When I think of America an' England and
      all the worl' we know to-day, I can no' believe that such wicked things
      can happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was anything but unreal to Doane. He knew too well that America and
      England, even all the white peoples, make up but a fraction of the
      inhabitants of this strange earth. His eyes filled again as he considered
      the possible&mdash;yes, the probable fate of the lovely girl at his side.
      In such a time of disorganization the reckless Manchu woman at Peking
      could do much. Chang might lose his head at the sound of gunfire in Han
      Yang and fly back to the capital, or he might not. A capable and corrupt
      eunuch would run heavy risks to gain such a prize. For a huge prize the
      viceroy's collection would indeed be; many of the priceless stones and
      paintings would never reach the throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought came of trying to persuade her to save herself; a thought that
      was as promptly discarded. She would not leave her father while he lived.
      He, of course, would not take his own life elsewhere than in his ancestral
      home. And to that home, with his inevitable escort of underlings and
      soldiers, was hurrying&mdash;if not already there&mdash;this Chang
      Yuan-fu, one of those powerfully venomous creatures that have figured
      darkly at intervals in the history of China.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane spoke low and quickly: &ldquo;Can you find out when Chang's train left
      Peking, Miss Hui?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have try ver' har' to learn. I think they don' know that. It is so
      importan' to know that, too, because my father&rdquo;&mdash;Her voice faltered.
      Doane once again, with a swift glance to left and right, took her hand
      and, for a brief moment, gripped it firmly. &ldquo;You haven' yet spoken to my
      father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, dear Miss Hui.... you must smile!.... I have found it very
      difficult to think out a way of approaching him. Your father is a great
      viceroy. He might take it ill that I should venture to interfere in what
      he would feel to be the supreme sacred act of his life. He might&rdquo;&mdash;Doane
      hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;even for you he might feel that he couldn't turn back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said, very low. &ldquo;I have thought of tha', too. But they shall
      never take me to Peking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He understood. The suicide of girls as a protest against unwelcome
      marriage was a commonplace in China. It was, indeed, for thousands the
      only way out. She knew that, of course. And she spoke there out of her
      blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will speak to-morrow,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Before we reach Huang Chau. We
      have nothing to lose. He can only rebuff me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt now that in this tragic drama was bound up all that might be left
      to him of happiness. The guiding motive of his life was&mdash;there was a
      divine recklessness in the thought&mdash;to save Hui Fei, to make her
      smile again, with a happy heart. She whispered now:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He asked her, abruptly changing his manner, almost distantly courteous,
      about her life in an American college. Little by little, as she made the
      effort to follow him into this impersonal atmosphere, her brightness
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The record was scraping its last. Applause came from the dancers, in which
      she joined. The Manila Kid wound the machine again, and the dancers swung
      again into motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am asking too much of you,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;But I have been frighten'. I
      coul'n' think wha' to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had to set his teeth on the burning phrases that rushed from his long
      unpractised heart, eager for utterance. &ldquo;I will take you back to your
      father,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his mind it was settled. Whatever strange events might lie before them,
      they should not take her to Peking. His own life, as well as hers, stood
      in the way. It had come to that with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was near to midnight when the <i>Yen Hsin</i>, on advices from Hankow,
      headed again upstream. At the first throb of the engine the white
      passengers stopped dancing and came out on deck. There was gaiety, even a
      little cheering.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was perhaps two hours later when Doane, asleep in his cabin, heard the
      shots, confused with the incidents of a dream. But at the first screams of
      the women below decks he sprang from his berth. Some one was banging on
      his door; he opened; the second engineer stood there, coatless and
      hatless, a revolver in his hand, and a little blood on his cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All hell's broken loose below,&rdquo; said the young Scotchman. &ldquo;Chief's down
      there. I tried to get to him, but&mdash;God, they're all over the place&mdash;fighting
      one another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are, MacKail?&rdquo; Doane hurriedly drew on trousers and coat, and thrust
      his feet into his slippers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The viceroy's soldiers. Revolutionary stuff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane got his automatic pistol from a drawer in the desk; quickly filled
      an extra clip with cartridges; went forward. The Scotchman had already
      gone aft.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engine was still running, the steamer moving steadily up the moonlit
      river. The uproar below decks sounded muffled, far-away. It might have
      been nothing more than a little night excitement in a village along the
      shore. The shooting continued. Men were shouting. There were more shrill
      screams; and then splashes overside. As he hurried forward, staring over
      the rail, Doane caught a passing glimpse of a face down there in the foam
      and a white arm. The white men were stumbling drowsily out of their
      cabins; he saw one of the customs men, in pajamas, and Tex Connor. They
      hurled questions at him but he brushed them aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Benjamin stood over the cringing pilot with a revolver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Engine room don't answer!&rdquo; he shouted coolly enough. &ldquo;And we can't get to
      it. Take MacKail and try to get through. I'll make this rat keep her in
      the channel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane ran back. More of the men were out, talking excitedly together. He
      paused to say: &ldquo;Get any weapons you have, every man of you, and see that
      none but women get up to this deck! Keep the men down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      MacKail stood at the head of the port after stairway, outside the rear
      cabins, a big Australian beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're just naturally carving one another up,&rdquo; observed the Australian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Doane, and went down the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noise and confusion were great down here. Women were crowding out of
      the lower cabins, sobbing hysterically, tearing their hair and beating
      their breasts, crowding forward and aft along the deckway or climbing
      awkwardly over the rail and slipping off into the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane shouted a reassuring word in their own tongue; pointed to the steps;
      finally drew one girl forcibly back from the rail and started her up.
      Others followed, screaming all the way. Still others clung to the white
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane broke away and plunged into the dim interior of the boat. Most of
      the lights were out. Dark figures were wrestling. There were grunts,
      groans, savage cries of rage and triumph. A huge pole-knife caught the
      light as it swung. Doane was aware of men breathing hard as they
      struggled.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stumbled over an inert body; would have fallen had not the Australian
      caught him. A tall soldier who lunged toward them with a dripping bayonet
      was shot by MacKail.... There were no means here of distinguishing the
      parties to this savage struggle, but in the inner corridor it was lighter.
      Near at hand two of the republicans&mdash;queues cut off, dressed in an
      indistinguishable but odd-appearing uniform of some light gray stuff with
      a white cloth tied about the left arm, had heaped bodies across the
      corridor and were shooting over them at a darker mass just forward of the
      engine room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane shouted at the republicans, ordering them to withdraw. They shook
      their heads angrily. One, even as he tried to reply, sank into a limp heap
      with a dark stream trickling from a hole in his forehead. His comrade bent
      low to reload his rifle. With the shouting of many hoarse voices the dark
      mass up forward came charging down the corridor. Doane was firing into
      them when MacKail and the Australian caught his arm and drew him back
      through the doorway. From that position, however, all three could shoot
      the blue-clad attackers as they plunged by the opening. Then, however,
      they had to defend themselves. The soldiers came on by dozens. Doane had
      his second clip of cartridges in his pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get back!&rdquo; he shouted to the others. &ldquo;Guard the steps&mdash;they'll be
      coming up for loot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They retreated. Two bodies lay huddled on the steps they had left but a
      few moments earlier. A few dead women were on the deck and one or two men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as they stepped over the bodies and mounted to the deck above, all
      three men, their faculties sharpened to a supernatural degree by the ugly
      thrill of combat, took in the details of what was evidently accepted among
      these republican rebels as their uniform&mdash;a suit of unmistakably
      American woolen underwear, the drawers supported by bright-colored
      American suspenders; socks worn outside (like the suspenders) with garters
      that bore the trademark name of an American city, and finally, American
      shoes. So the enthusiasm of these young revolutionists for the greatest of
      republics found expression! And across the breast of each, lettered on a
      strip of white cloth, was the inscription that Sun Shi-pi had so glibly
      translated as &ldquo;Dare to Die.&rdquo; Sun must have brought along these supposedly
      Western uniforms in his pedler's trunks.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was never to be known what surprising incidents had preceded this
      sudden slaughter. The chief engineer might have told, but his mutilated
      body Doane found, on his second attempt to get through, lying just across
      the sill of the engine room, as if he had been stepping out to reason with
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entire battle lasted barely half an hour. It was, for the white folk,
      a period of confusion and terror. Toward the end, the blue men, utter
      outlaws now, made rush after rush up the various stairways and ladders,
      only to be fought back at every point by the white men and the few
      surviving officers of his excellency's force. They were like the most
      primitive savages, knowing neither fear nor reason. The blood-lust that at
      times captures the spirit of this normally phlegmatic and reasonable
      people drove them for the time to the point of madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, however, they drew off below. Two of the boats were within their
      reach. These they lowered, and despite the speed of steamer and current,
      though not without evident loss of life, they got them over, tumbled into
      them, and fell away into the night astern. Then for the first and last
      time this night Doane saw the redoubtable Tom Sung. He stood in the nearer
      boat, brandishing a rifle and screeching wild phrases in Chinese.
    </p>
    <p>
      MacKail took the engine room. Captain Benjamin, still, grimly, pistol in
      hand, held the pilot to his task. There was no crew to clean the shambles
      below decks, yet with the few loyal soldiers who had managed to hide away
      now at the furnaces, the steamer wound her way steadily up-stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane found what had once been the earnest Sun Shi-pi in the starboard
      corridor, below. On his body were the uniform, white brassard and motto of
      the &ldquo;Dare to Dies.&rdquo; They had beheaded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passengers, clad and half clad, nervous, talkative, hung about the
      decks. The two teachers, curiously self-possessed, sat side by side at the
      dining table. From the quarters of his excellency, aft, came the
      continuous sound of women moaning and wailing.... It was, to the eye, but
      a river steamer plowing up-stream in the moonlight. But to the senses of
      those aboard the situation was a nightmare, already an incredible memory
      while sleep-drugged eyes were slowly opening.... To the mighty river it
      was but one more incident in the vivid, often bloody drama of a
      long-suffering, endlessly struggling people....
    </p>
    <p>
      In his spacious cabin, his eyes shaded from the electric light by a screen
      of jade set in tulip wood, dressed in his robes of ceremony, wearing the
      ruby-crowned hat of state with the down-slanting peacock feather, his
      excellency sat quietly reading the precepts of Chuang Tzü.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hui Tzü asked,&rdquo; (he read) 'Are there, then, men who have no passions? If
      he be a man, how can he be without passions?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'By a man without passions,' replied Chuang Tzü, I mean one who permits
      neither evil nor good to disturb his inner life, but accepts whatever
      comes.... The pure men of old neither loved life nor hated death.
      Cheerfully they played their parts, patiently awaited the end. This is
      what is called not to lead the heart away from Tao.... The true sage
      ignores God; he ignores man; he ignores a beginning; he ignores matter; he
      accepts life as it may be and is not overwhelmed. If he fail, what matters
      it? If he succeed, is it not that he was provided through no effort of his
      own with the energy necessary to success.... The life of man passes like a
      galloping horse, changing at every turn. What should he do; what should he
      not do? It passes as a sunbeam passes a small opening in a wall&mdash;here
      for a moment, then gone.... let knowledge stop at the unknowable. That is
      perfection.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is to be doubted if even Doane gave regard at the moment to the
      possible origin of the fire. It had spread through two or three of the
      upper cabins by way of the ventilating grills and was roaring out through
      a doorway by the time he heard the new outcry and ran to the spot. The
      white men were rushing about. Rocky Kane, collarless, disheveled, was
      fumbling ineffectually at the emergency fire hose; him Doane pushed aside.
      But the flames spread amazingly; worked through the grill-work from cabin
      to cabin; soon were licking at the walls and furniture of the social hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane left Dawley Kane and Tex Conner&mdash;an oddly matched couple&mdash;manning
      the hose, others at work with the chemical extinguishers, while he went
      forward through the thickening smoke to the bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Benjamin said, huskily, almost apologetically&mdash;his eyes red
      and staring, his face haggard: &ldquo;I'm beaching her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in another moment she struck, where the channel ran close under an
      island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lowering the boats without a crew proved difficult. Already the fire had
      reached those forward. Doane, the other mate and MacKail did what they
      could. The Chinese women crowded hither and thither, screaming, rendering
      order impossible. In the confusion one boat drifted off with only Connor,
      the Manila Kid, and Miss Carmichael.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Benjamin was cut off by the quick progress of the flames. The
      whole forward end of the cabin structure was now a roaring furnace,
      fortunately working forward on the down-stream breeze rather than aft. The
      flames blazed from moment to moment higher; sparks danced higher yet; the
      heat was intense. Doane sent the viceroy and his suite below, aft, where
      the deck was still strewn with bodies and slippery with blood. With three
      available boats, fighting back the crowding women and the more excitable
      among his excellency's secretaries, he sent ashore, first the women, then
      his excellency and the men. Hui Fei&mdash;she had slipped hastily into the
      little Chinese costume she wore at their midnight talk, and had thrown
      about it an opera cloak from New York&mdash;went in one of the first
      boats; Doane himself handed her in. The two teachers, pale, very composed,
      followed. At the oars were two of the customs men, faces streaked with
      grime and sweat.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his excellency, as the last boats got away, Doane said: &ldquo;I will follow
      you soon. I must look once more for the captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will send back a boat,&rdquo; said the viceroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane ran up to the upper and promenade decks. There was no sound save the
      roaring and crackling of the fire. There seemed no chance of getting
      forward. In the large after cabin stood the six-fold Ming screen. Quickly
      he folded it; there seemed a chance of getting it ashore. He thought, with
      a passing regret, of the <i>pi</i> of jade; but there was no reaching his
      own cabin now. He stepped out on deck. There, clear aft, leaning against
      the cabin wall, stood Rocky Kane, like a man half asleep, rubbing his
      eyes; and crouching against his knee, clinging to his hand, was the little
      princess in her gay golden yellow vest over the flowered skirt and her
      quaint hood of fox skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane caught the young man's shoulder; swung him about; looked closely
      into the dull eyes with the tiny pupils.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that again, eh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't understand&rdquo;&mdash;thus Rocky&mdash;&ldquo;I don't see how it could have
      happened. It couldn't have been my fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane saw now that his head had been burned above one ear; and the hand
      that pressed his face was blistered white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>wasn't</i> my fault! I found myself out on deck. I tried to get the
      hose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I saw you. Quick&mdash;get below.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane tenderly lifted the little princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rocky was still incoherently talking; promising reform; blaming himself in
      the next breath after hotly defending himself. His voice was somewhat
      thick. He was drowsy&mdash;swayed and stumbled as he moved toward the
      stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane, speaking gently in Chinese to the child, stood a moment
      considering. The heat was becoming intolerable. It wouldn't do to keep the
      little one here. He carried her down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below, the boy faced him. &ldquo;I'm no good,&rdquo; he whimpered. &ldquo;I can't wake up.
      Hit me&mdash;do something&mdash;I won't be like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane considered him during a brief instant. They were standing under a
      light, their feet slipping on the deck, bodies lying about. With the flat
      of his hand, then, Duane struck the side of the boy's head that was not
      burned; struck harder than he meant, for the boy went down, and then,
      after sprawling about, got muttering to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right!&rdquo; he cried unsteadily. &ldquo;I asked you to do it. I'm going to
      get hold of myself. I've been no good&mdash;rotten. I've touched bottom.
      But I'm going to fight it out&mdash;get somewhere.&rdquo; His egotism, even now
      amazingly held him. Even as he spoke he was dramatizing himself. But his
      pupils were widening a little; he was in earnest, crying bitterly out of a
      drugged mind and conscience. And Doane, looking down at him, felt stirring
      in his heart, though curiously mixed with a twinge of jealousy for his
      youth and the hopes before him, something of the sympathy his long deep
      experience had instilled there toward blindly struggling young folk. Boys,
      after all, were normally egotists. And Heaven knew this boy had so far
      been given no sort of chance!
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane led the way clear aft. The heat was terrific. From a row of fire
      buckets he sprinkled the little princess; bathed her temples. The water
      was warm, but it helped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Kane, with a nervous movement, suddenly picked up one, then another,
      of the buckets and dashed them over himself. Distinctly he was coming to
      life. &ldquo;We may never come out of this, Mr. Doane,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It's a
      terrible fix.&rdquo; More and more, as he came slowly awake, he was dramatizing
      the situation and himself. &ldquo;But I want to say this. I've never known a man
      like you. You're fine&mdash;you're big&mdash;you've helped me as no one
      else has. I'll never be like you&mdash;it isn't in me. I've already gone
      as close to hell as a man can go and perhaps still save himself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you swim?&rdquo; asked Doane shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;why, yes, a little. I'm not what you'd call a strong swimmer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane was wetting the princess's face and his own. There would be little
      time left. There was smoke now. He found a slight difficulty in breathing;
      evidently the fire had eaten through, forward, to the lower decks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They won't be able to get a boat back here,&rdquo; he said, and quietly pointed
      out the still blazing pieces of board that, after whirling into the air,
      were drifting by. A terrific blast of heat swept about them, indicating a
      change of wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait here a moment for me,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I must make one more effort to
      find Captain Benjamin. If that fails, we can swim ashore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried working his way forward when the heat proved too great in the
      corridor, climbing out on the windward side of the hull. But the flames
      were eating steadily aft; he could not get far. Beaten back, he returned
      to the stem to discover that the child and Rocky Kane were gone. After a
      moment he saw them in the water, a few rods away, first a gleam of yellow
      that would be the jacket of the little princess, then their two heads
      close together.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lowered himself down a boat-line and swam after them. In the water this
      giant was as easily at home as in any form of exercise on land. Within the
      year he had swum at night, alone, for the sheer vital pleasure the use of
      his strength brought him, the nine miles from Wusung to Shanghai&mdash;slipping
      between junks and steamers, past the anchored war-ships and a great P.
      &amp; O. liner from Bombay. The water was cool, refreshing. He stretched
      his full length in it, rolling his face under as one arm and then the
      other reached out in slow powerful strokes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Kane was having no easy time of it. He was clearly out of wind. And
      the child whimpered as she clung tightly about his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave you up,&rdquo; he sputtered weakly. Then added, with an evidence of
      spirit that Doane found not displeasing: &ldquo;No, don't take her, please! Just
      steady me a little.&rdquo; He was struggling in short strokes, splashing a good
      deal. &ldquo;We ought to touch bottom now pretty quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sampans and the boats of the cormorant fishers were edging into the wide
      circle of light about the steamer. Along the shore of the island clustered
      the groups of mandarins, their silk and satin robes forming a bright spot
      in the vivid picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane found the sand then; walked a little way and helped the nearly
      exhausted boy to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're coming down the shore,&rdquo; said Rocky, trying, without great
      success, to speak casually.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane looked up and saw them running&mdash;white men, Chinese servants,
      mandarins holding up their robes, women, and last, walking rapidly, his
      excellency.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Hui Fei, throwing off her cloak and running lightly ahead, who took
      the frightened child from young Kane's arms and carried her tenderly up
      the bank. There as the attendants gathered anxiously about them, she
      tossed the child high, petted her, kissed her, until the tears gave place
      to laughter. The tall eunuch wrapped the little princess then in his own
      coat; and Hui Fei accepted the opera cloak that transformed her again in
      an instant from a slimly quaint Manchu girl to a young woman of New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane stood by. Toward him she did not look. But to Rocky Kane, who lay on
      the bank, she turned with bright eagerness. He got, not without effort, to
      his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smiling&mdash;happily, it seemed to the bewildered, brooding Doane&mdash;she
      gave him her hand; led him to meet her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have met Mr. Kane,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was he who save' little sister. He
      risk' his life to bring her here, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rocky, throwing back his hair and brushing the water from his eyes, stood,
      his sensitive face working nervously, very straight, very respectful, and
      took the hand of the viceroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, then, manhood in him. The viceroy recognized the fact in his
      friendly smile. Hui Fei plainly recognized it as she walked, chatting
      brightly, at his side, while he bent on her a gaze of boyish adoration.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Doane, he moved away unobserved; dropped at length on a knoll,
      rested his great head on his hands, and gazed out at the blazing steamer.
      She would soon be quite gone. Poor Benjamin was gone already; a strange
      little man, one of the many that drift through life without a sense of
      direction, always bewildered about it, always hoping vaguely for some
      better lot. It had been a tragic night; and yet all this horror would soon
      seem but an incident in the spreading revolution. It had always been so in
      China. In each rebellion, as in the mighty conquests of the Mongols and
      the Manchus, death had stalked everywhere with a casual terribleness. Life
      meant, at best, so little. Genghis Khan's men had boasted of slaying
      twenty millions in the northwestern provinces alone within the span of a
      single decade. The new trouble must inevitably run its course; and what a
      course it might prove to be! From the mere effort to face this immediate
      future Doane found his mind recoiling; much as strong minds were to
      recoil, only three years later, when the German army should march through
      Belgium.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave up that problem, came down to the particular thought of this
      swiftly growing new love that had stolen into his heart. The hope of
      personal happiness had passed now. Self seemed, like the life to which it
      so eagerly clung, not to matter. Instead that hope was growing into a
      profound tenderness toward the girl. She was, after all&mdash;the thought
      came startlingly&mdash;about the age of his own daughter, Betty, whom he
      had not seen during these three strange years. Betty and her journalist
      husband would be somewhere in Turkestan now; he was studying central Asia
      for a book, she sketching the native types. For a long time no letter had
      come.... It was a fine experience, this unbidden stir of the emotions,
      this thrill. There was mystery in it, and wonder. Merely to have that
      almost youthful responsiveness still at call within his breast was an
      indication that life might yet hold, even for him, the derelict, rich
      promise. And it was a reminder, now, to his clearing brain that his life
      must be service. He must find terms on which to offer himself, his gifts.
      His spirit had been molded, after all, to no lesser end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The viceroy drew away then from the group about the child; came
      deliberately along the bank. The increasing tenderness Doane felt toward
      Hui Fei reached also to her father, who was facing with such fine dignity
      the grim ending of a richly useful life. Now, perhaps, he could plead with
      him for the daughter's sake. Somehow, certainly, happiness must be found
      for her. In pleading he would be serving her.
    </p>
    <p>
      His brain was swinging into something near balance; it was, after all, a
      good brain, trained to function clearly, mellowed through patient years of
      unhappiness. It would help him now to fight for the girl, to save her, if
      he might, from the dark ways of the Forbidden City. She called herself so
      naively an &ldquo;American.&rdquo; The West had thrilled her. She must not be given
      over to the eunuch, Chang.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, even as he contrived a sort of self-control, even as he determined to
      forget his own little moment of romantic hopefulness, the lover within him
      stood triumphant over all his other selves.

      CHAPTER VII&mdash;THE INSCRUTABLE WEST
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>OANE knew nothing
      of the dignified figure he presented as he took the viceroy's hand, a
      profoundly sobered giant, his huge frame outlined beneath his wet garments
      like a Greek statue of an athlete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have helped to save the life of my child, Griggsby Doane&rdquo;&mdash;thus
      his excellency, in what proved to be a little set speech&mdash;&ldquo;and with
      all my heart I thank you. I am old. Little time is left to me. But life
      follows upon death. Death is the beginning of life. It has been said by
      Chuang Tzü that the personal existence of man results from convergence of
      the vital fluid, and with its dispersion comes what we term death.
      Therefore all things are one. All vitality exists in continuing life. And
      I, when what I have thought of as my self arrives at dispersion, shall
      live on in my children. My words are inadequate. My debt to you is beyond
      my power to repay. Command me. I am your servant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane bowed, hearing the words, catching something of the warm gratitude
      in the heart of the old man, yet at the same moment flogged on to action
      by the sense of passing time and present opportunity. It was no simple
      matter, it seemed, to approach this seasoned, calmly determined mind
      regarding the final personal matter of life and death. But he plunged at
      it; stating simply that he had heard the gossip of the impending tragedy,
      and that in conversing with the lovely Hui Fei, who was in obvious
      difficulty in existing between the two greatest civilizations without a
      solid footing in either, he could not bear to think of her possible fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rang Yu listened attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Excellency,&rdquo; Doane pressed on, &ldquo;it is not right that you should
      listen to the command of a decadent throne. Forgive my frankness, my
      presumption, but I must say this! True, you are a Manchu. While this
      revolution continues it will be difficult for you. But before another year
      shall have gone by there will be a new China. The bitter animosities of
      to-day will pass. Though a Manchu, your wise counsel will be needed. Your
      knowledge of the Western World will temper the over-emphatic policies of
      the young hot-heads from the universities of Japan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The viceroy considered this appeal during a long moment; then, soberly, he
      looked up into the massive, strongly lined face of the white man and
      asked, simply: &ldquo;But what would you have me do, Griggsby Doane?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Excellency knows of the plan to seize your property?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kang inclined his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you go on to your home, it may be that everything will be taken, even
      the money on your person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kang bowed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, Your Excellency, why not now&mdash;while you yet have the means to
      do so&mdash;escape down the river with your daughter and myself? Can you
      not trust yourself and her in my hands? I will find means to convey you
      safely to Shanghai&mdash;perhaps to Japan or Hong Kong&mdash;where you
      will be secure until further plans may be laid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Griggsby Doane,&rdquo; replied the viceroy with simple candor, &ldquo;you speak
      indeed as a friend. And I would be false to the blood that flows in my
      veins did I not prize the friendship of man for man, second only to the
      love of a son for a parent, above every other quality in life. Friendship
      is most properly the theme of many of the noblest poems in our language.
      It is to us more than your people, who place so strong an emphasis on love
      between the sexes, can perhaps bring themselves to understand. And
      therefore, Griggsby Doane, your feeling toward myself and my daughter
      moves my heart more deeply than I can express to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not surprising that news of my sorrow&mdash;of this sad ending that
      is set upon my long life&mdash;should have reached you. But since you know
      so much, I will tell you, as friend to friend, more. Do you know why this
      sentence has been passed upon me? It is because I could not bring myself
      to obey the order of the throne that the republican agitator, Sun Shi-pi
      who had sought sanctuary at my yamen in Nanking should be at once
      beheaded. Instead I sent for Sun Shi-pi to counsel him. I permitted him to
      go to Japan on condition that he engage in no conspiracies and that he
      remain away. Instead of complying with my condition he hastened to
      organize revolutionary propaganda. He returned to China, appeared in
      disguise on the steamer that is burning out yonder, and is now dead,
      there, in his republican uniform.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So his information was complete! A picture rose in Doane's mind of the
      headless trunk of Sun Shi-pi amid the horrors of the lower deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      His excellency continued: &ldquo;I was denounced at the Forbidden City as a
      traitor. The sentence of death followed, in the form of an edict from the
      empress dowager in the name of the young emperor. Were I now to follow Sun
      Shi-pi into exile in a foreign land I would mark myself for all time as a
      traitor indeed; as one who, while sharing as an honored viceroy the
      prosperity and dignity of the reigning dynasty, conspired toward its
      downfall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Your Excellency, the empress dowager and the young emperor no longer
      speak with the voice of the Chinese people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That could make no difference, Griggsby Doane. By edict of the Yellow
      Dragon Throne of Imperial China I have been instructed to go to my
      ancestors. My allegiance is only to that throne. I will obey.... Already,
      Griggsby Doane, you have done for me more than one can ever demand of a
      friend. And yet one more demand I must make upon you. There is no other to
      whom I can turn. I have no other friend to-night. Within a short time my
      secretaries will secure a launch or a junk to convey us to my home near
      Huang Chau. Will you come with us there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane, surprised, bowed in assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. The gratitude of myself and all my family and friends will
      remain with you. You are a princely man.... Until later, then, good night,
      Griggsby Doane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane walked farther along the bank; stood for a time absorbed in thought
      that led, at length, to what seemed a new ray of light in the darkness
      that was his mind. And he strode back, hunting in this group and that for
      Dawley Kane. That man had offered help. Now he could give it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dawley Kane, fully dressed, unruffled, quietly smoking a cigar and looking
      through a pocket notebook by the light from the river, seemed a note of
      sanity in an unbelievably confused world. To him, apparently, the
      nightmare of fighting and slaughter on the steamer, like the fire, were
      but incidents. The only evidence the man gave out of quickened nerves was
      that he talked a little more freely than usual. To Doane he presented a
      surface as clear and hard as polished crystal, impenetrable, in a sense
      repelling, yet, as we say, a gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      They even chatted casually, as men will, standing there looking out at the
      fire (which now had reached the stem and eaten down to the lower decks,
      incinerating alike the bodies of men who had died for faith and for lust)
      and at the wide circle of light on the rim of which floated the
      vulture-the boats of the rivermen. Doane forced himself into the vein of
      the man's interest; riding roughshod over a desperate sense of unreality.
      For he knew that the great masters of capital were often proud and even
      finicky men who must be approached with skill. They were kings; must be
      dealt with as kings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kane was interested to learn what relation the fight below decks might
      have to the rebellion up the river. That, clearly, was characteristic of
      the man&mdash;the impersonal gathering in and relating of observable data.
      His interest was deeper in the agriculture and commerce of the immense
      Yangtze basin, to which subject he easily passed. His questions came out
      of a present fund of knowledge&mdash;questions as to the speed,
      cargo-capacity and operation-cost of the large junks that plied the river
      by thousands, as to the cost of employing Chinese labor and the average
      capacity of the coolie. He knew all about the slowly developing railroads
      of North and Central China; commented in passing on the surprising profits
      of the young Hankow-Peking line.... He seemed to Doane to have in his mind
      a map or diagram of a huge, profitmaking industrial world, to which he
      added such bits of line or color as occurred in the answers to his
      questions. But he gave out no conclusions, only questions. Famines, other
      wide-spread suffering so tragically common in the Orient, interested him
      only as an impairment of trade and industrial man power. The opium habit
      he viewed as an economic problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane, settling doggedly to his purpose, found himself analyzing the power
      of this quiet man. It lay of course, in the control of money. And money
      would be only a token of human energy. The religion of his own ardent
      years had taken no account of earthly energy or its tokens; it had
      directed the eyes of the bewildered seeker toward a mystical other world.
      Yet human life, in the terms of this earth, must go on. To this point he
      always came around, of late years, in his thinking, just as the church had
      always come around to it. Money was vital. The church was endlessly
      begging for it; in no other way could it survive to continue turning away
      the puzzled eyes of the seekers.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the immense energy created in the human struggle to live and prosper
      must continually be gathering up, here and there, into visible power that
      shrewd human hands would surely seize. He felt this now as a law. Religion
      had not left him. He felt more strongly than ever before that this
      miraculously continuing energy implied a sublime orderly force that
      transcended the outermost bounds of human intelligence. Religion was
      surely there: it only wanted discovering. It had, as surely, to do with
      primitive energy, with the heat of the sun and the disciplined rush of the
      planets, with the tragic struggle of human business, with work and war and
      sex and money.... And then he indulged in a half-smile. For this primitive
      undying energy could be no other than the Tao of Lao-tzu and Chuang Tzü.
      And so, after all these groping years of his errant faith, he had fetched
      up, simply in Taoism.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that law seemed to stand. The human struggle created power that tended
      to gather at convenient centers. And here beside him, smoking a cigar,
      stood a man whose uncommon genius fitted him to seize that power as it
      gathered and administer it; a man to whom money came&mdash;the very winds
      of chance heaped it about him. And to Doane, just now, money&mdash;even in
      quantity that would be to Kane hardly the income of a day or so&mdash;meant
      so much that the grotesque want of it (the word &ldquo;grotesque&rdquo; came) stopped
      his brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      For it was coming clear to him how completely the throne could at will,
      obliterate the worldly establishment of Kang Yu. That throne, however
      politically weak, yet held the savage instruments of despotic power.
      Kang's sad end would come within the twenty-four hours, perhaps; certainly
      he would wait only to prepare himself and to write his final papers. The
      eunuch's men would be everywhere about the household; nothing could be
      hidden from them, or from the spies among the servants.... With money&mdash;a
      little money&mdash;Hui Fei might be saved from an end as tragic as her
      father's.... The thing, surely, could be managed. For the moment it seemed
      almost simple. She could be spirted away. There might he missionaries to
      escort her down the river on one of the steamers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then, while Doane's thoughts still raced hither and thither, that
      Kane himself broached the vital topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This viceroy&rdquo;&mdash;thus Kane&mdash;&ldquo;seems to be quite a personage. He's
      been a diplomat, I believe. And Kato tells me has an excellent collection
      of paintings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane felt himself turning into a trader. &ldquo;You are interested in Chinese
      paintings, are you not, Mr. Kane?&rdquo; he asked guardedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. I have something of a collection. And now and then Kato picks up
      something for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, of course, how far you would care to go with it Mr. Kane&rdquo;&mdash;Doane
      was measuring every word as it passed his lips&mdash;&ldquo;but there is a
      possibility that a bargain could be struck with his excellency at this
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be advisable to act pretty quickly, I should say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! This is interesting. You are informed about his collection?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a general way. It is very well known out here. His collection of
      landscapes of the Tang and Sung periods is supposed to be the most
      complete in existence, with fine works of Ching Hao, Kuan Tung, Tung Yuan
      and Chu-jan. The best known paintings of Li Chang are his. He has several
      by Kao Ke-ming, and, I know, an original sixfold landscape screen by Kuo
      Hsi. Then there are works of the four masters of southern Sung&mdash;Li
      Tang, Lui Sungnian, Ma Yuen and Hsia Kuai. You would find nearly all the
      great men of the Academy represented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane stopped; waited to see if this list of names impressed the great
      American. If he knew, in his own person, anything whatever about Chinese
      painting he must exhibit at least a little feeling. But Dawley Kane said
      nothing; merely lighted, with provoking deliberation, a fresh cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is commonly understood, too&rdquo;&mdash;Doane could not resist pressing him
      a little further&mdash;&ldquo;that he has authentic paintings by Wu Tao-tzu, and
      Li Lung-mien.&rdquo; Surely these two names would stir this man who seemed at
      moments no more than a calculating machine with manners. But Kane smoked
      on.... &ldquo;And I understand that he has a fairly complete collection of
      portraits by the men of the Brush-strokes-reducing Method.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He finished rather lamely; fell silent, and looked out over the still
      brilliantly lighted river; the river of a hundred thousand dramatic scenes&mdash;battles
      and romances and struggles for trade&mdash;the great river with its
      endless memories of gold and bloodshed&mdash;the river that for a brief
      day was running red again. The fire out there, though red flame and
      rolling smoke and whirling sparks still roared upward, was consuming now
      the lower deck and the hull. Within the hour the <i>Yen Hsin</i> would be
      no more than a curving double row of charred ribs; one more casual memory
      of the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Dawley Kane smoked on. He clearly knew no enthusiasm. He was an
      analyst, an appraiser, a trader to the core. He felt no discomfort, even
      in friendly talk, in letting the other man wait. But Doane would say no
      more. And finally, knocking the ash off his cigar with a reflective
      finger, Kane remarked; &ldquo;You really think that this collection would be a
      good buy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unquestionably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any idea what he would ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't even know that he would consider selling it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if he were properly approached.... there are reasons____&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know of his predicament?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gather that there is a predicament.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh.... well, yes, there is. But I don't know how even to guess at the
      value. Many of the paintings are priceless. In New York, at collector's
      prices, and without hurrying the sale....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred thousand dollars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many times more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if he is anxious to sell&mdash;must sell&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is that, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred thousand is a good deal of money. If I were to place that sum
      to his credit to-morrow, for instance, by wire, at a Shanghai bank, don't
      you suppose it would tempt him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might. Though Kang knows the value of every piece.&rdquo; Doane was finding
      difficulty in keeping pace with the situation. Kane would shave every
      penny, as a matter of principle. That, of course, explained him; was the
      secret of his wealth and power. Paintings, after all, mattered to him only
      in a remote sense; you could always buy them if you chose, if people
      would, as apparently they did, think better of you for buying them. It
      came down to the desirability of building up and solidifying one's name,
      of what Doane had heard spoken of everywhere in America during his last
      visit as &ldquo;publicity.&rdquo; The word irritated him. It suggested that other
      word, also heard everywhere in America, &ldquo;salesmanship.&rdquo; These words, to
      the sensitively observant Doane, had connoted an unpleasant blend of
      aggressive enterprise with an equally aggressive plausibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his wits were sharpening fast. If this man was a buyer, he would be a
      seller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His excellency has another collection that might or might not interest
      you&mdash;the value of it would be only slightly artistic&mdash;his
      precious stones.&rdquo; Doane threw this cut carelessly. &ldquo;There is no estimating
      the value of those. It might run into the millions....&rdquo; He saw Kane's eyes
      come to a sudden hard focus behind the veil of smoke. He was really
      interested at last. And Doane, with mounting pulse, quietly added, &ldquo;He has
      historical jewels from many parts of Asia&mdash;head ornaments, bracelets,
      ropes of matched pearls from Ceylon, old careen jade from Khotan,
      quantities of the jewelry taken from Khorassan and Persia by Genghis Khan
      and his sons, including a number of famous royal pieces, and some of the
      jeweled ornaments brought from the temples of India by Kublai Khan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, Doane knew, was enough. He waited, now, himself. Waited and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Doane&rdquo;&mdash;Kane, at last, was speaking&mdash;&ldquo;I would be glad to
      have you approach the viceroy for me. To-night, if you think best. I will
      be glad, of course, to pay you a commission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I make a definite offer&mdash;for the paintings and the jewels?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Kane considered. &ldquo;Let him set a price. Then we will make our offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is safe to say, Mr. Kane&rdquo;&mdash;Doane was remembering experiences of
      men in church and educational work who had had to approach the great
      capitalists for gifts of money&mdash;&ldquo;that you could sell half the
      paintings for what you might pay for the two collections at this time.
      That would enable you to give the other half, as a collection bearing your
      own name, to one of the art museums at home, at no cost to yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kane smoked thoughtfully. &ldquo;I presume, Mr. Doane,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the
      predicament you spoke of can not interfere in any way with the safe
      delivery of the collections.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane considered. How much did this man know? That Japanese, behind his
      mask of a smile, would be deep, of course. With a sudden sinking of the
      heart, Doane perceived that Kane might easily know the whole story. But
      even if he did he would admit nothing. He trusted no one; that was his
      calm cynical strength. He would trade to the last.... Another swift, if
      random, perception of this tense moment was that much of the common talk
      regarding the &ldquo;inscrutable&rdquo; East was utter nonsense. Read in the light of
      history and habit the Oriental mind was anything but deeply mysterious; it
      was, indeed, very nearly an open book. Whereas the Western mind, with its
      miraculous religion, its sentimentality and materialism and (at the same
      time) its cynically unscrupulous financial power, could be baffling
      indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Desperate now, seeing no other way through, Doane spoke out from his
      tortured heart. &ldquo;Mr. Kane, the simple fact is that his excellency has been
      condemned to death, and his daughter to a fate that will almost certainly
      end in death for her as well. They are seizing his property....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Imperial Government&mdash;the empress dowager and her crew. They are
      sending the chief eunuch, Chang Yuan-fu, to take his paintings and jewels,
      and his daughter, to Peking. Frankly, it may be necessary to hurry matters&mdash;smuggle
      the things out. But the fan paintings can be packed in parcels, the
      scrolls rolled small on their ivory sticks, the jewels gathered in a few
      boxes. Once in white hands they would be safe. I think. I believe I can
      arrange it. The porcelains and carvings you would probably have to leave
      behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice died out. Dawley Kane was coolly appraising him. Their minds
      were not meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you are stating it now, it is a different situation altogether,&rdquo; said
      Kane, the ring of tempered metal in his voice. &ldquo;Obviously the man to deal
      with is the eunuch, What's-his-name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;really&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would have the collections complete including the porcelains and the
      carvings. I should want them all. He would be ignorant and corrupt, of
      course; we could buy him for a song. And there would be no risk. Yes, let
      him get possession. Then if you would like to approach him for me I will
      be glad to see that you make something for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane drew in his breath. Slowly he said: &ldquo;But that, Mr. Kane, seems a
      good deal like taking a profit out of the viceroy's misfortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he caught himself. To Kane, who had made enormous profits out of
      wrecked railways, who had cornered stocks and produce and mercilessly
      squeezed the short sellers, this would be sentimentality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane heard himself saying: &ldquo;I'm sorry. I could hardly undertake it, Mr.
      Kane.&rdquo; And walked away. His failure was complete. Worse, if there had been
      any gaps in the information supplied by the ubiquitous little Kato, they
      were filled now. The finely balanced machine that served so smoothly as a
      brain in the head of the great American, would be working on and on.
      Through the Japanese he could easily enough reach Chang Yuan-fu from
      Hankow after the tragedy that now hovered so close over the old viceroy
      and all that was his. He could make what he and his suave kind would
      doubtless regard&mdash;the slang word came grimly&mdash;as a killing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The white men had made a small fire of dry rushes and thwarts from the
      boats. There sat Hui Fei, the sleeping little princess in her arms; and,
      beside her, Rocky Kane. Near by, where the men had spread coats on the
      ground, Miss Means and Miss Andrews slept side by side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane walking toward the group&mdash;stopping, moving away only to turn
      irresolutely back&mdash;saw young Kane reach over and take the child into
      his own arms, and saw Hui Fei smile at him. He strode away then,
      struggling to believe that she could do that. But she had.... After all,
      she knew only that he had acted outrageously toward her, had then
      apologized publicly, boyishly, and now had brought her little sister
      ashore, himself falling exhausted on the bank. With those few facts, out
      of her impulsively young judgment she could strike a balance in his favor.
      Even at his worst he had bluntly admired her; for that she might, in the
      end, forgive him. And his youth would call to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deane, indeed, forced himself to consider the boy dispassionately. The
      wild oats of any spoiled youth with too much money at his disposal, if
      brought together, and closely scrutinized, would make an appalling
      showing. Wild young men did, of course, recover. There was in this boy a
      note of intensity&mdash;passionate, eager&mdash;that was by no means all
      egotism. And there was in the father a hard sort of character that had
      proved itself indomitable, and that must be taken into account. Yes, it
      was a simple fact, that many a young fellow had gone farther wrong than
      had Rocky Kane without wrecking his adult life. You couldn't tell. And
      there they were, the eager moody boy and the lovely girl, who was oddly,
      quaintly conspicuous in her opera wrap, sitting very close, talking in low
      tones while he walked alone. It was torture.... yet it wras an awakening.
      He told himself that it was better so... Pacing back and forth, dwelling
      on the quick changeableness of youth, its ardor and sensitive hopefulness,
      he thought&mdash;reaching out for fellowship as will always the hurt soul&mdash;of
      other lonely lives, of Abelard and Jean Valjean, of St. Francis, even of
      Christ. It was odd&mdash;from his present philosophical position of
      something near Taoism he felt the legendary Christ as a profoundly human
      and friendly spirit, immeasurably more tender, finer, gentler than the
      theological structure of thought and conduct that had been erected in His
      name. He had thought himself very nearly around the circle, back to
      essential good.... This process could bring only humility. Life began to
      matter less. Love was a tormenting problem of self; the mature soul must
      in some measure attain selflessness if it were not to go down in the
      trampled dust of life. Worldly success was an accident. It was hardly
      desirable; hardly mattered. That he had within the hour pinned his hope to
      money, fairly fought for it, began to seem incredible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The viceroy found him standing quietly by the river, turning from the
      slowly dying fire out there to the slowly spreading glow in the eastern
      sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like to think,&rdquo; remarked his excellency, smiling in friendly fashion,
      &ldquo;that when the first Buddhist patriarch, Bodhidharma, miraculously crossed
      the river on a reed plucked from the southern bank, it was not far from
      here, near my home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was not your city of Huang Chau the home of Li To?&rdquo; asked Doane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, yes!&rdquo; cried his excellency. &ldquo;In some of his excursions on the
      river he undoubtedly passed the site of my home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane quoted from that most famous of rhapsodists in musical Chinese:
      &ldquo;'One who has hearkened to the waters roaring down from the heights of
      Lung, and faint voices from the land of Ch'in; one who has listened to the
      cries of monkeys on the shores of the Yangtze Kiang and the songs of the
      land of Pa'.... That&rdquo;&mdash;he was musing aloud, reflectively as the
      Chinese do&mdash;&ldquo;was written three full centuries before William of
      Normandy first set foot on British soil.... Li Po so described himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They talked on, of life and philosophy, in, language interwoven with
      classical allusions. Friendship, the finest relationship in Chinese
      civilization, as it stood, had come to them.... It brought a kind of
      peace. Doane failed to recognize this sensation as in some degree but a
      phase of his painful exaltation. It seemed to him then that his struggle,
      no matter what atonement might lie before, was over. He forgot again the
      Western vigor that was, and to the last would be, driving his spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the swiftly growing acquaintanceship of Huj Fei and Rocky Kane
      was weaving its bright-tinted weft in and out through the dark warp of
      Rocky's ill-spent youth. His eyes followed the slightest movement of her
      slim hands and rested dog-like on her finely modeled head about which the
      shining wet black hair lay close. To his quick youth she was an exquisite
      fairy. He felt her as perfume in the air he breathed. Her voice, when she
      drowsily, prettily spoke, fell on his ear like music in an enchanted land.
      He could say little; he had never before so lost himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried daintily to conceal a yawn. And he, clasping the child in both
      arms, turned away to hide its brother. Then, very softly, she laughed and
      he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must try to sleep,&rdquo; he said gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can no' let you keep my sister. You, too, are ver' tire'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's nothing. I love to hold her. Really! You see, my life hasn't been
      this way. Maybe, if I'd had a sister...&rdquo; He stopped; suddenly, vividly
      sensing what he had been; a hot flush flooded his sensitive face. He could
      only add then: &ldquo;I want you to sleep. It may be hours before the boat comes
      for you. It's been such a horrible night&mdash;such a nightmare....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you mus' res', too. One of the servan's will take my sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he cried, low, fiercely, &ldquo;I won't let any one else have her!&rdquo;
       Sensing crudely that the child was a chord between them, he tightened his
      hold. The little head rolled back on his arm; he bent over, tenderly
      kissed the soft cheek, then looked over it at Hui Fei, staring. During one
      brief moment their eyes met full in the flickering yellow light.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned away; in lieu of speech looked about for a spot to lay her
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; He laid the child on the ground; and, surprised to find himself
      collarless and coatless, took off his waistcoat, rolled it up and placed
      it for a pillow. &ldquo;It's really pretty well dried out,&rdquo; he added, with an
      embarrassed little laugh.... Then, as she still said nothing, went on, &ldquo;Do
      just lie down there. I'll keep awake. We can't count on the servants;
      they're all scared to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still she hesitated. &ldquo;I'm afraid I am ver' tire',&rdquo; she finally remarked
      unsteadily. &ldquo;I can't think ver' clearly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said he, hardly hearing. &ldquo;I've got to tell you something. I'm
      not good enough so much as to speak to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I don' wan' you to talk abou'&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mean that. It's other things too.&rdquo; His voice broke, but after a
      moment he pressed on, a determined look on his curiously youthful face.
      &ldquo;I've done every rotten thing I could think of. I'm&mdash;well, I guess
      I'm just a criminal. No, listen&mdash;please! It's true. I'm to blame for
      this awful fire&mdash;smoking opium in my cabin. It was my lamp&mdash;it
      must have been. I fell asleep. But I knew better, of course.... Oh, God,
      it's terrible! All those lives, all this suffering! And you&mdash;I've
      nearly killed you&mdash;when it was you....&rdquo; Here, creditably, he caught
      himself. &ldquo;Don't think I'm talking wildly. I'm getting at something. Seeing
      you, meeting you&mdash;and now, this&mdash;well, I've never seen anybody
      like you. It's bowled me off my feet. I know what love is, now&mdash;Oh,
      please! I've got to get this out. I love you. I'm crazy about you. I can
      say that because pretty soon that boat'll come and you'll go and I'll
      never see you again. It's right, too! I've got to start again&mdash;alone
      and prove that there's good stuff in me somewhere...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm ver' tire',&rdquo; she murmured wistfully; and resting her head on the
      rolled-up waistcoat she lay still.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she had only let him finish! There had been something&mdash;some point&mdash;he
      was getting at. He hadn't meant to tire her or hurt her.... When the tall
      eunuch came for the little princess he angrily drove the fellow away. For
      Hui Fei was sleeping now, peacefully, like the warm little child in his
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      An English gunboat was the first relief craft to arrive; in the cool dawn;
      a tiny craft, built for the river, with a white freeboard low as a
      monitor's and bridge structure forward of the thin high funnel. The small
      boat that came ashore made a number of trips, taking off the passengers
      and the surviving white officers of the <i>Yen Hsin</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      His excellency refused, with calm courtesy, to set foot on the English
      gunboat that was built for the river; he would wait for the junk that had
      been sent for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dawley Kane found his son, nodding, with the picturesquely-clad child in
      his arms. The boy, glancing at the sleeping Hui Fei whose head rested
      comfortably on the rolled-up waistcoat, gave the child now to the
      patiently waiting eunuch, then fairly dragged his father to the boat. With
      the Japanese, Kato, and oddly distant to the big mate and the suddenly
      exotic-appearing viceroy in his richly embroidered satins who had been
      after all only casually, for a few days, in their lives, they embarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had nearly reached the gunboat when those on the bank heard young
      Kane's voice raised in hot protest. There was a moment of argument; then a
      splash. The boy could be seen then swimming back to shore. And Dawley
      Kane, turning his back, went on to the gunboat, stepped aboard, and
      disappeared. Rocky clambered, dripping, up the bank; came straight to
      Duane, a staring, exhausted youth, very white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't do it.&rdquo; he panted. &ldquo;They've just told me&mdash;Kato and the pater&mdash;about
      this terrible trouble of the viceroy's and&mdash;and Miss Hui Fei's....
      The pater said it was time I&mdash;got clear of any new entanglement. I
      quit him. Oh, I suppose you'll think me a&mdash;damn fool, but&rdquo;&mdash;at
      this point he nearly broke into tears&mdash;&ldquo;but I love that girl, Mr.
      Doane! If I can't be of some use to her&mdash;now, in this awful trouble&mdash;I
      don't want to live. Will you&mdash;help me? And let me help?&rdquo;.... And, all
      blind confidence, he offered his hand to the big mate; who took it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gunboat hoisted anchor and swung about, heading down-stream. Passing
      her, upward bound, came a large junk, with the rig of a trader from
      Szechuen, her single huge rectangular sail, brown-umber 'n tint and
      closely ribbed with battens of bamboo, flat against the one mast that
      towered clumsily amidships. The eight long sweeps, in the low waist and
      forward, moved rhythmically in time with the syncopated, wailing chant of
      nearly a hundred oarsmen. The <i>tai-kung</i> crouched, bamboo pole in
      hand, just within the prow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hull was of cypress, stained from stem to stern with yellow orpiment
      and rubbed to a polish with oil. The high after-deck structure, all of
      fifty feet in length, terminating in a projecting gallery-twenty feet or
      higher above the water, was carved everywhere in intricately decorative
      designs; as were, also, the roof over the tillerman's stand on the deck
      house and the gallery railing (just within which stood a row of flowering
      plants in yellow and green pots). The many small windows along the sides
      were glazed with opalescent squares of ground oyster shells and glue;
      those across the stern (under the gallery) with stained glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      To no one aboard the gunboat or among the still waiting groups on the bank
      did the thought occur that this craft might be engaged in other than
      peaceable business. Her like were not an uncommon sight along the always
      crowded river. The passing attention she drew was merely that aroused by a
      richly decorative object moving beautifully (with a remarkably detailed
      reflection) through the flat water, that itself glowed under the red and
      gold of the early morning sky like a great sheet of burnished old copper.
      It was not observed that three white faces peered warily out of the
      shadow, behind as many opened windows; nor could it easily be seen that
      the figure in blue, sitting, knees drawn up, on the deck house just behind
      the <i>laopan</i> who mercilessly urged on the sweat-shining oarsmen, was
      none other than the redoubtable Tom Sung.

      CHAPTER VIII&mdash;ABOARD THE YELLOW JUNK
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>N making their
      escape from the steamer, Tex Connor and the Manila Kid seized one of the
      small boats, manning, one at either end, the tackle-falls. Connor was
      quick, rough, profane. The Kid, breathless with excitement, hesitant,
      glancing back over the rail for a thinly girlish face that did not, then,
      appear, worked with ten thumbs at the ropes. Connor's end, the boat, fell
      first, a short way, nearly pitching him out. He cursed this futile man,
      his jackal, roundly; then clung to the tackle as the stern fell.... The
      Kid moaned with pain as the slipping hemp burned the skin off his fingers,
      but held it just short of disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hot red flames licked out overhead as the boat jerkily dropped. The women
      were screaming up there. A white man, the second mate, leaned over,
      swearing vigorously at them. They passed an open freight gangway, where
      bodies lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ready, now!&rdquo; cried Connor. &ldquo;Let go with me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute, can't you?&rdquo; whined the Kid. He was peering into the dark
      interior of the steamer; grasping a moment more; wrapping a handkerchief
      about his left hand. &ldquo;My God! Can't a fellow tie up his hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A thin blue figure appeared, stepped lightly over into the boat and
      dropped on a middle thwart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dixie!&rdquo; cried the Kid in falsetto.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wore a cap, and carried an oddly lady-like shopping bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where'd you come from?&rdquo; growled Connor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw you start,&rdquo; said the girl casually. &ldquo;Come on&mdash;let's get away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connor stared at her; then turned back to his work. The boat struck the
      water and drifted rapidly away down-stream. Connor, roaring angrily at the
      Kid, got out an oar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; asked Miss Carmichael very quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going ashore?&rdquo; said Connor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come, Tex!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Use your head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked sharply, inquiringly, doubtingly at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You two better row straight down-stream as hard as you can,&rdquo; she added.
      &ldquo;You can bet Tom Sung and that gang aren't going to show themselves at Kiu
      Kiang. They've stopped somewhere below here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Kid, who was nursing his hand, looked up; wrinkled his low forehead
      that was hatless, and then softly whistled. Connor made no remark, but
      continued studying the girl with his one eye. Finally, with an effort at
      reasserting his authority, he growled:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take an oar, Jim!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my hands! My God, that rope took all the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you expect me to do the rowing, Jim?&rdquo; said Miss Carmichael.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Kid yielded then. The girl settled herself comfortably in the stem,
      looking back at the fire. Soon they were out of the circle of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Connor drew in his oar; stowed it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dixie,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;You've made up your mind to go through with this
      business, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have to come across if you want my help. I won't go it blind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Carmichael glanced back at the red glow in the sky, then out toward
      the slightly paling East.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you by sunrise,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The thing won't keep much longer
      than that, anyhow. It'll have to be fairly quick work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Connor. &ldquo;That's an agreement. Now I'm going to take a
      nap. This current's taking us down fast enough. When you sight Tom's
      outfit, wake me up.&rdquo; With which he curled up in the bow, and soon was
      snoring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Kid stowed his own oar, and crept to the girl's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Careful!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;If he should wake up....&rdquo; She extricated
      herself from an encircling arm. &ldquo;Jim&mdash;sit still now!&mdash;It's time
      you and I had an understanding. I need you, and I'm going to use you. I
      don't propose to have you all steamed up, either. You'll need all the
      nerve you've got. Perhaps more. I'm not at all sure that you're big enough
      for what you've got to do. That's the difficulty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You promised, Dixie.&rdquo; He was still absurdly breathless. &ldquo;You said it was
      a trade&mdash;if I'd stick to you, you'd stick to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. But it's during the next eight or ten hours that you're going
      to find out what sticking to me, means. You can have me, all right, Jim,
      but you've got to earn me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I'll earn you, all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if you have the courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God, for you, Dixie&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hand fell lightly on his; and her voice, very small and calm, broke in
      with: &ldquo;Supposing I told you to kill a man. Would you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She heard, felt, his breath stop. Then he whispered, with one swift glance
      at the sleeping Connor: &ldquo;If I say yes, Dixie, will you kiss me? Right now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pressed her lips slightly; then replied: &ldquo;No. Not yet. And you needn't
      kill anybody until I tell you to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it&mdash;is it&rdquo;&mdash;his whisper was huskier&mdash;&ldquo;is it&mdash;him,
      Dixie?&rdquo; He was staring with less certainty now, at Connor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&rdquo;&mdash;said she slowly&mdash;&ldquo;nobody in particular. But anything may
      happen to-night, Jim. And we can't falter. Not now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She let him press her hand during a brief moment; then made him resume his
      seat. And from behind lowered lids she watched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once he came back, to ask hoarsely: &ldquo;You said he was rough with you, Dix.
      Did he&mdash;did you and he&mdash;my God, if I thought that Tex had&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She caught his shoulder and placed a hand over his mouth: held him thus
      while she said: &ldquo;If he catches you back here, Jim, he'll kill you. No
      fear! Now you go back there and show me that you can play cards. You're
      sitting in the biggest game of your life. Jim Watson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He crept back; puzzled, something hurt. There was a sting in her voice.
      Could it be that the girlish Dixie was as cold-blooded as that? Treating
      him like a child! Hadn't she any feelings? The question came around and
      around in his muddy brain, confused with frantic uprushes of jealousy
      against the big man who slept and snored in the bow.... hadn't she any
      feelings?.... She was excitingly desirable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as a conquest, now; something to brag about.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Dixie who sighted the soldiers, sitting in heated argument on the
      bank not a hundred yards below a big junk that lay moored to stakes in an
      eddy. She called sharply to Connor; they pulled straight in beside the
      other two boats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Sung came to the water's edge, a rifle (with set bayonet) in his hand.
      Connor stepped out, holding the boat. The Kid, with a furtive, glance at
      the big yellow fighter, and the abruptly silent shadowy group on the bank,
      cautiously got out an automatic pistol and held it beside him on the
      thwart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dixie said sharply, for Connor's ears: &ldquo;Put up that gun, Jim!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Kid obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke then to Connor direct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell your man we want that junk,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Get out these other boats
      and take it, quick. Then we'll start back up-stream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Connor was nonplussed. The girl's assumption of authority was
      complete. Even the slow-thinking Tom Sung felt her presence and turned
      abruptly from himself toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, though angered, Connor controlled himself. She meant, after all,
      business. Dixit wasn't a girl to make careless mistakes. She knew, none
      better, what any success, little or big, might be worth in risks run. So,
      speaking sharply, he gave his orders to Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quietly the twenty or more outlaw soldiers came down to the boats and
      pushed off. Rowing and paddling they crept up on the junk. A drowsy
      watchman peeped over at the rail, forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they were alongside. Catching at the mooring poles, the soldiers
      stepped out on the wide sponson that curved down, amidships, nearly to the
      water-line. Quickly, rifles slung on backs but revolvers at their girdles
      and knives in their teeth, they went up the ropes hand over hand, their
      bare feet dinging monkeylike to the smooth side.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were cries aboard now, and a confusion of running feet. The first
      soldier to get a leg over the rail came tumbling back with a split skull,
      bounding off the sponson into the water and sinking as he drifted away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connor and the Kid caught together at the sponson. Connor stepped out; and
      calling on a belated soldier to give him a back, climbed laboriously,
      puffing but determined, up over the rail, pausing at the top only to call
      back for the Kid to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that worthy hesitated, crouching, clutching at the boat painter. &ldquo;I've
      got to hold the boat here!&rdquo; he shouted back; but Connor had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was much noise up there now&mdash;shouts, groans, appalling
      screeches, shots, and that insistent pattering of feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dixie, watching critically the crouching figure on the sponson&mdash;for
      the Kid was shivering and making little sounds, obviously caught in the
      acute physical distress into which extreme sudden fear will at times
      plunge a man&mdash;called abruptly: &ldquo;Jim&mdash;look up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A nearly naked Chinese was lowering himself in a deliberate gingerly
      manner down a moving rope nearly overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kill him, Jim!&rdquo; Dixie added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Singling out her clear voice from the tumult, the yellow man looked
      fearfully down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Kid, at the same moment, looked up; then, fumbling in a curiously
      absent way for his pistol, glanced back at Dixie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll hold the boat,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Go on&mdash;kill him!&rdquo; She sat quietly,
      one thin arm reached out to the nearest mooring pole, looking steadily up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Kid, nerving himself, suddenly burst into a storm of wild oaths and
      shot three times into the body above him. At the first shot the man
      slipped down a little way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Push him away!&rdquo; Dixie cried sharply. &ldquo;I don't want him falling into the
      boat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was shooting again; and then with an effort diverted the falling body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dixie got up, and stood steadying herself in the gently rocking boat; and
      the Kid&mdash;quit; out of breath now, and muttering, as he fondled the
      hot pistol, &ldquo;Well, I did it, didn't I? I did what you said!&rdquo;&mdash;found
      in her eyes, shining through the dusk of early dawn, a bright white light
      that was, to him, disconcerting and yet profoundly thrilling. He shivered
      again as he felt the spell of her strange genius. What a woman, he was
      thinking again, but wildly, madly, now, to conquer.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she was saying, &ldquo;I guess your nerve's all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Other shining yellow bodies were tumbling over the side and floating away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help me up there, Jim!&rdquo; she commanded. &ldquo;Never mind tying the boat&mdash;let
      it go! It's only a giveaway. Quick&mdash;give me a hand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was beside him on the sponson. He clasped her in his arms; but before
      he could kiss her she slapped him sharply. &ldquo;Keep your head!&rdquo; she
      commanded. &ldquo;Put me up there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lifted her high; until she could kneel, then stand, on his shoulder.
      She went over the rail as lightly as a boy. She found the soldiers in
      small groups cornering one or another of the crew, torturing and hacking
      at them with bayonets and knives, and during a brief moment looked on with
      a curious keen interest. The master, or <i>laopan</i>, crouched,
      whimpering, on the poop.... She saw Connor standing by the mast, just
      above the well, amidships and forward, where were huddled the survivors
      among the crew (their number surprisingly large); Connor was panting,
      revolver in hand, and scowling about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dixie stepped to his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got to save enough of this crew to work the boat up the river,
      Tex,&rdquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm saving enough of 'em,&rdquo; he replied gruffly. &ldquo;We've only killed a dozen
      or so. There was more'n a hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The heavily evil-looking Tom Sung reluctantly detached himself from one of
      the groups and came over, wiping his bayonet casually on his sleeve. Mr.
      Connor roughly ordered to gather his men together and make ready to get
      under way. To the Kid, who came awkwardly over the rail just then, Connor
      gave merely a glance. Then to Dixie, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come up here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led the way up the steps with the carven hand rail to the poop; gave
      the <i>laopan</i> a careless kick; stepped around the steersman's covered
      pit and out astern on the high projecting gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, fixing his one eye on Her, &ldquo;where's this place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned away to the pots of flowers that stood closely spaced just
      within the elaborate woodwork of the railing. There were chrysanthemums,
      white, yellow and deep Indian red; highly cultivated double dahlias; red
      lotus blossoms; and tuberoses that filled the fresh morning air with their
      heavy perfume. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Connor added explosively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said I'd tell you by sunrise, Tex,&rdquo; she said, coolly pleasant; and
      hummed, very softly, a music-hall tune, bending over a spreading lotus
      blossom with every appearance of ingenuous girlish interest. After a
      moment, she went on, &ldquo;The thing now is to get this junk up the river as
      fast as it will go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo; He was controlling his voice, but his face, usually
      expressionless, was brutally clouded...."Push me just a little farther,
      Dix, and you'll go overboard. And there won't be any flowers at the
      funeral. By God, I'm not sure I wouldn't enjoy it. You got me into this
      business! Now if you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better control yourself, Tex,&rdquo; said she; straightening up before him. &ldquo;I
      may have got you in, but it's a real job now. You've got to go through.
      And you're going to need me. The place is a few miles this side of a town
      called Huang Chau, on the north hank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beyond Hankow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, below. It's only a matter of hours getting up there, if you'll just
      get this junk started.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How'll we know it when we get there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All we've got to do is ask a native, anywhere along the bank, where Kang
      Yu lives&mdash;his old home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The viceroy of Nanking. Why don't you use that eye of yours once in a
      while, Tex&mdash;look around you a little?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly his mind, so quick at the vicious games of his own race, picked up
      and related the facts. His face relaxed, as he thought, into the familiar
      wooden expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're sure the stones are there?&rdquo; he asked, quietly now.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded; hummed again; caressed the flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Dix,&rdquo; he said then, as he turned to go forward, &ldquo;that sounds
      square enough. I guess I can handle it all right. And I'll see that you
      get your share all hunky dory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you figuring my share to be?&rdquo; she asked, glancing casually up
      from a lotus blossom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he cried without hesitation, almost playfully, &ldquo;you and I aren't
      going to have any trouble about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went then; and she lingered among the flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      From beyond the long deck house came shouts and wailing. The great sweeps
      were got overside. The mooring poles were hoisted out and lashed along the
      sponsons. The clumsy craft swung out into the river and moved slowly
      forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of a hasty light step Dixie looked up into the haggard gray
      face of the Kid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; he whispered, glancing fearfully behind him. &ldquo;Wha'd he say
      to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dropped her eyes; turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick! Tell me, or by God, I'll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She threw up a frail white hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now, Jim!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll have to sleep. There's work ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you think <i>I</i> can sleep&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't either, Jim. It's dreadful. But I'm going to tell you everything.
      You have a right to know. Wait till we're past the steamer. We'd better
      get below now anyhow. We mustn't be seen. If we aren't, they'll never
      suspect this junk. Then make sure he's asleep and come up here. I'll be
      waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Kid brought Dixie's breakfast of rice and eggs and tea to the gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cook was only wounded a little,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Tom's got him working
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dixie was reclining on a Canton chair of green rushes over a bamboo frame,
      her head resting languidly near the tuberoses. Now and again she drew in
      deeply the rich odor. And beyond the fringe of flowers and the carven
      railing she could see the river. Junks moved slowly by, sliding down with
      the current&mdash;somber seagoing craft out of Tientsin and Cheefoo and
      Swatow and even Canton. By a village were clustered open sampans, and
      slipper-boats with their coverings of arched matting. The small craft of
      the fishermen with suspended nets or with roosting, crowding cormorants
      clustered here and there along the channel-way. Everywhere farmers and
      their coolies were at work in the fields. A family&mdash;father, mother,
      boys and girls&mdash;worked tirelessly with their feet a large irrigating
      wheel at the water's edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Kid seated himself on the deck and mournfully looked on while she ate.
      Perversely she delayed her narrative, playing with time and life. In her
      oblique way she was happy, exercising her gift for gambling on a scale new
      in her experience. Indeed, for the thrill she now experienced, Dixie
      Carmichael would have paid almost any price. Life itself&mdash;the mere
      existing&mdash;-she held almost as cheaply as the Chinese. Deliberately,
      with nerves steady as steel instruments, she finished her simple breakfast
      and then put the bowls aside on the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lying back, averting her face, gazing off down the river, she began the
      narrative that she had framed within the hour. Her manner, calm at first,
      soon offered evidences of deeply suppressed emotion. Her voice exhibited
      the first unsteadiness the Kid had ever heard in it. She drew out an
      embroidered handkerchief from the pocket of her blouse and pressed it once
      or twice to her eyes, as, with an air of dogged determination, she talked
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The narrative itself dealt with her girlhood near San Francisco, her
      chance meeting with Tex Connor, then a well-known character on the western
      coast of America, her girlish infatuation with him, and an elopement that
      she had supposed would end in marriage. Instead she found her life ruined.
      Connor had beaten her, degraded her, driven her into vice. She ran away
      from him; reached the China Coast; settled down with every intent to
      become what she termed, in his and her language, a square gambler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I took up with you a little last year, Jim, it seemed to me that at
      last I'd found a man I could tie to. You never knew my real feelings. I'm
      not the kind that tells much or shows much. I guess perhaps my life's been
      too hard. But&mdash;oh, Jim!&mdash;well, you're, seeing the real girl now.
      I'm pretty well beaten down, Jim.... You're getting the truth from me at
      last. I've got to tell it&mdash;all of it&mdash;for your own sake. You're
      in worse trouble than you know, right now. The cards are stacked against
      you, Jim. Your life even&rdquo;&mdash;her voice broke; but she got it under
      control&mdash;&ldquo;I'm going to save you if I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moodily he watched her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it was anybody but Tex! He's merciless. He's strong. He never
      forgets.... Listen, Jim! Tex came clear from London to find me. And he
      found out about&mdash;us&mdash;you and me. That I was growing fond of you.
      He never forgets and he never forgives. Oh. Jim, can't you see it! Can't
      you see that that's why he took you on&mdash;so he could watch you, keep
      you away from me? Can't you see what a game I've had to play? God, if
      you'd heard what he said to me back here this very morning&mdash;Oh, it's
      too awful! I can't tell you! He's so determined! He gets his way, Jim&mdash;Tex
      gets his way!.... Oh, what can I do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, wait&mdash;I've got to tell you the whole thing. You said he was
      planning to cross me. He'll do that, of course. I don't think I care much
      about that. But you, Jim&mdash;oh, you poor innocent boy! If you could
      only see! You'll never get your hands on one of the viceroy's jewels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned her face toward him. Her eyes now were swollen and wet with
      tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim, gray of face, held in his two hands a Chinese knife, balancing it.
      There were stains on the blade. He must have picked it up, she reflected,
      here on the junk. For it wouldn't be like him to carry such a weapon. It
      seemed to her then that he was holding his breath. She saw him moisten his
      blue lips with the tip of an ashen tongue. He was trying to speak. At
      least his lips parted again. She waited. When the voice did finally come,
      it was so hoarse that he had evident difficulty in making it intelligible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tex may be strong&mdash;but if you think I'm afraid&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jim.... no, I don't mean that! Not that! Oh, I don't know what I'm
      saying-! It's only when I think how happy you and I might be&mdash;think
      of it! really rich! able to go and live decently somewhere, like regular
      folks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silently, with surprising stealthy swiftness, he got to his feet. His
      right hand, with the knife, busied itself in a side pocket of his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say the word, Dixie&rdquo;&mdash;his face was contorted with the muscular
      effort necessary to produce this small sound&mdash;&ldquo;say the word, and I'll
      kill him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, Jim!&rdquo; she covered her face with her thin hands, and sobbed, very
      low. &ldquo;Oh God, what can we do? Isn't there some other way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say the word,&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it be&rdquo;&mdash;she broke down again&mdash;&ldquo;would it be&mdash;where a
      man's a devil, where he's threatened&mdash;wouldn't it be like defending
      ourselves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say the word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jim&mdash;-God forgive me!.... Yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her lips barely framed the word. But he read it. She watched him as he
      stepped around the huge coils of tracking rope on the roof of the
      steersman's pit; watched until he dropped softly down and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, lying back, very still, she listened. But the oarsmen were chanting
      up forward, the <i>laopan</i> shouting; nearer, the steersman was singing
      an apparently endless falsetto narrative (as if there had never been
      bloodshed). The minutes slowly passed. She drew in the sweet exhalation of
      the tuberoses.... still no unusual sound. She herself exhibited no sign of
      excitement beyond the hint of a cryptic smile and the white light in her
      eyes.... Her shopping bag lay on her lap. Opening it, she looked at the
      bracelet watch, that nestled close to a small triangular bottle of green
      corrosive sublimate tablets.... The gentle wash of the current against the
      hull gave out a soothing sound. The slowly rising sun beat warmly down,
      and the polished deck radiated the heat. A sensation of drowsiness was
      stealing over her. For a short while she fought it off; but then, deciding
      that no anxiety on her part could be of value, she yielded, closed the bag
      on her lap, and drifted into slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was pleasantly warmer still. She felt her eyes about to open&mdash;slowly&mdash;on
      a presence. This languor was delicious. As an almost ascetic epicure in
      sensations she rested a moment longer in it, thinking dreamily of
      priceless gems heaped in her hollowed hands; of luxurious idleness in some
      exotic port&mdash;Singapore, or Penang (she had loved the tropical
      splendor of Penang), or in Burmah or India&mdash;Rangoon say, or even
      Lucknow, Lahore and Simla. They would know less about her there. And with
      the means to operate on a larger scale she should be able to add
      enormously to her wealth. She decided to dress and act differently; make a
      radical change in her methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lips parted. The presence before her&mdash;coatless, little cap pushed
      back off the low forehead&mdash;was Connor. He had pushed aside a flower
      pot to make a seat on the rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      She closed her eyes again. He still wore the gray flannels and the white
      shoes with the rubber soles-It would be the shoes that had enabled him to
      approach without awakening her. He was smoking a cigar And the face was
      wooden again&mdash;save for his eye&mdash;He at stared oddly at her. And
      she thought his breathing somewhat short, just at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened her eyes again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've had a good nap,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smoked, and stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Jim?&rdquo; she asked then; quite casually: raising herself on an
      elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no reply; smoked on, still a thought breathless, fixing her with
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He brought me some breakfast, just before I fell asleep.... What time is
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For what seemed a long space he did not even answer this; merely smoked
      and stared. She had never, sensitively keen as were her perceptions, felt
      so curious a hostility in Connor. She had hitherto supposed that she
      understood him, short as had been their actual acquaintance&mdash;-her
      narrative of a past with him in America, as related to Jim, was false&mdash;but
      the man before her now, sitting all but motionless on the railing, smoking
      with an odd rapid intensity, holding that cold eye on her, was wholly
      alien.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally he replied: &ldquo;It's afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; She sat up. &ldquo;Have we been going right along?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood erect; covered a yawn; then with her thin hands smoothed down
      the wrinkled blue skirt about her hips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I look like the devil,&rdquo; she remarked. The thin hands went to her hair.
      &ldquo;You haven't noticed any sort of a mirror in the cabin, have you, Tex?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faintly through the still air came a faint sound&mdash;a boom&mdash;boom-bom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; she asked sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fighting around Hankow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're not way up there?&rdquo; She stepped to the side and looked out ahead.
      &ldquo;There's a city!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom says it's Huang Chau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello! We're there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He inclined his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tie up here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She heard now other and more confused sounds. The junk was slowing down;
      working in toward the yellow shallows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now listen!&rdquo; said he. She glanced at him, then away, apparently
      considering the quiet landscape; alien he was indeed, and hostile, his
      manner that of an inarticulate man struggling with a set speech....
      &ldquo;Listen! You're smart enough. But I want you to understand I don't trust
      you.''
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you, Tex?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I go ashore, you're to stay here&mdash;right here on this deck&mdash;where
      you are now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the big idea, Tex?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There'll be men to see that you do stay here. I want you to get this
      straight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said she musingly, &ldquo;you won't be able to rob me outright.
      You'll have to give me enough of a share to keep me quiet afterward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what's to prevent the crew from getting away with the junk. I'm not
      very keen about being carried off that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't worry. I'm taking the master along with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood then; looked meaningly at her; then went forward. She noted that
      his two hip pockets bulged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly the long narrow craft was worked in toward the land. Trackers
      sculled ashore in sampans and made the great hawsers fast to stakes. Then
      the crew, with a deal of shouting and many casual blows, were assembled in
      the long well forward of the mast, where they huddled abjectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keeping around the steersman's house, Dixie contrived to take in much of
      the scene. There was quarreling among the soldiers. Tom Sung towered over
      them, shouting rough orders. The two men that were told off (she judged to
      guard her and the junk) appeared to be objecting to their part in the
      affair. Obviously there would be small loot here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connor came back over the deck house; stood angrily over her. She sensed
      the mounting brutality in him. For that matter, his sort and their ways
      with women were familiar enough to her. She had learned to take brutal men
      for granted. But it had not occurred to her that Connor would strike her.
      However, he did. Knocked her to her knees; then to her face; even kicked
      her as she lay on the deck. He was suddenly loud, wild.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None o' this peeking around!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Keep your eyes where they
      belong!&rdquo; And left her there.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little she was able to creep to the rail and peer out through the
      flowers. Frightened members of the crew were sculling the sampans back and
      forth, until at length the whole party, every man except the <i>laopan</i>
      armed, fully assembled, set off inland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond an unpleasant headache she felt no injury. She sat for a little
      while; then again looked forward. The two guards were on the deck house,
      talking excitedly together. While she watched they climbed down, shouted
      at the huddled crew, fired a careless shot or two into the mass of them
      that brought down at least one. At length two of the crew went over the
      side, followed by the soldiers. A moment later the sampan appeared moving
      toward the shore, the two soldiers loudly urging on the oarsmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dixie, swiftly then, rearranging her disordered hair as she walked, went
      down into the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      A corridor extended along one side from the <i>laopans</i> quarters under
      the steersman's house&mdash;sounds of stifled weeping came from there,
      apparently a woman or a girl&mdash;forward to the open space amidships.
      The rooms all gave on this corridor, the doorways hung with curtains of
      blue cotton cloth. Into one and another of these rooms she looked. There
      was bentwood furniture and bedding in each&mdash;-the latter tossed about.
      On the walls hung neat ideographic mottoes. The grillwork about the
      windows and over the doors was of a uniform and quaint design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connor had taken for himself the rear room. There she found, beneath the
      window a heap of matting and bedding. Thoughtfully, deliberately, she
      lifted it off, piece by piece, exposing first a foot and leg, then a bony
      hand, finally the entire figure of what had been Jim Watson, known, of
      recent years, along Soochow Road and Bubbling Well Road as the Manila Kid.
      His clothing was slashed and torn in many places. About his middle, and
      about his head, were wide pools of blood that during a number of hours,
      evidently, had been drying into the boards of the deck. The neck, she
      observed, on closer examination, had been cut through nearly to the
      vertebrae.
    </p>
    <p>
      During a swift moment she considered the grew-some problem; then carefully
      replaced the matting and bedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went forward then to the end of the corridor; paused to look in her
      shopping bag, open the triangular bottle and drop a few of the green pills
      into the pocket of her middy blouse, under her handkerchief; closed the
      bag and stepped out on the low midships deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sampan had just returned to the junk. The two soldiers were walking;
      rapidly inland after Connor's party. She let herself quickly over the
      side; stepped into the sampan; waved toward the shore. Meekly the cowed
      oarsmen obeyed the pantomime order.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stepped out on the bank, very slim, almost pretty; tossed a Chinese
      Mexican dollar into the boat, watched, with a faint, reflective smile, the
      two primitive creatures as they fought over it; then walked briskly, not
      without a trace of native elegance in her carriage, after the soldiers,
      lightly swinging her shopping bag.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX&mdash;IN A GARDEN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE road&mdash;narrow,
      worn to a deep-rutted little canyon&mdash;circled a brown hill, rose into
      a mud-gray village, where a few listless children played among the dogs,
      and a few apathetic beggars, and vendors of cakes, and wrinkled old women
      stared at the thin white girl who walked rapidly and alone; wound on below
      the surface of the cultivated fields; came, at length, to a wall of
      gray-brick crowned with tiles of bright yellow glaze and a ridge-piece of
      green, and at last to a gate house with a heavily ornamented roof of
      timbers and tiles. Other roofs appeared just beyond, and interlacing
      foliage that was tinged, here and there, with the red and yellow and
      bronze of autumn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great gates, of heavy plank studded with iron spikes, stood open,
      apparently unattended. Dixie Carmichael paused; pursed her lips. Her
      coolly searching eyes noted an incandescent light bulb set in the massive
      lintel. This, perhaps, would be the place. Almost absently, peering
      through into tiled courtyards, she took two of the green tablets from her
      pocket; then, holding them in her hand, stepped within, and stood
      listening. The rustling of the leaves, she heard, as they swayed in a
      pleasant breeze, and a softly musical tinkling sound; then a murmur that
      might be voices at a distance and in some confusion; and then, sharply,
      with an unearthly thrill, the silver scream of a girl.... Yes, this would
      be the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The buildings on either hand were silent. Doors stood open. Paper windows
      were torn here and there, and the woodwork broken in. But the flowers and
      the dwarf trees from Japan that stood in jars of Ming pottery were
      undisturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed through an inner gate and around a screen of brick and found
      herself in a park. There was a waterfall in a rockery, and a stream, and a
      tiny lake. A path led over a series of little arching bridges of marble
      into the grove beyond; and through the trees there she caught glimpses of
      elaborate yellow roofs. On either hand stood <i>pai-lows</i>&mdash;decorative
      arches in the pretentious Chinese manner&mdash;and beyond each a roofed
      pavilion built over a bridge.... She considered these; after a moment
      sauntered under the <i>pai-low</i> at her right, mounted the steps and
      dropped on the ornamented seat behind a leafy vine. Here she was sheltered
      from view, yet her eyes commanded both the main gate and the way over the
      marble bridges to the buildings in the grove.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked about with a sense of quiet pleasure at the gilded fretwork
      beneath the curving eaves of the pavilion, the painted scrolls above them,
      and the smooth found columns of aged nanmu wood that was in color like
      dead oak leaves and that still exhaled a vague perfume. The tinkling sound
      set up again as another breeze wandered by; and looking up she saw four
      small bells of bronze suspended from the eaves.... She sat very still,
      listening, looking, thinking, drawing in with a deep inhalation the
      exquisite fragrance of the nanmu wood. It might be pleasant, one day, to
      lease or even buy a home like this. So ran her alert thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The murmuring from the buildings in the grove continued, now swelling a
      little, now subsiding. It was not, of itself, an alarming sound, except
      for an occasional muffled shot. Her quick imagination, however, pictured
      the scene&mdash;they would be running about, calling to one another,
      beating in doors, rummaging everywhere. The drunkenness would doubtless be
      already under way. There would be much casual but ingenious cruelty, an
      orgiastic indulgence in every uttermost thrill of sense. It would be
      interesting to see; she even considered, her nerves tightening slightly at
      the thought, strolling back there over the bridges; but held finally to
      her first impulse and continued waiting here.
    </p>
    <p>
      A considerable time passed; half an hour or more. Then she glimpsed
      figures approaching slowly through the grove. They emerged on the farthest
      of the little marble bridges. One was Tex Connor; the second perhaps&mdash;certainly&mdash;Tom
      Sung. They carried armfuls of small boxes, at the sight of which Dixie's
      pulse again quickened slightly; for these would be the jewels. Tom
      appeared to be talking freely; as they crossed the middle bridge he broke
      into song; and he reeled jovially.... Connor walked firmly on ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stopped by the gate screen. Connor glanced cautiously about; then
      moved aside into a tiled area that was hidden from the gate and the path
      by quince bushes. He called to Tom who followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Carmichael could look almost directly down at them through the
      leaves. She watched closely as they hurriedly opened the boxes and filled
      their pockets with the gems. Tom used a stone to break the golden settings
      of the larger diamonds, pearls and rubies.
    </p>
    <p>
      A low-voiced argument followed. She heard Tom say, &ldquo;I come back, all
      light. But I got have a girl!&rdquo; And he lurched away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connor, looking angrily after him, reached back to his hip pocket; but
      reconsidered. He needed Tom, if only as interpreter; and Tom, singing
      unmusically as he reeled away over the marble bridges, knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connor waited, standing irresolute, listening, turning his eye toward the
      gate, then toward the trees behind him. The girl in the pavilion
      considered him. She had not before observed evidence of fear in the man.
      But then she had never before seen him in a situation that tested his
      brain and nerve as well as his animal courage. He was at heart a bully, of
      course: and she knew that bullies were cowards.... What small respect she
      had at moments felt for Tex left her now. She came down to despising him,
      as she despised nearly all other men of her acquaintance. Still peering
      through the leaves, she saw him move a little way toward the gate, then
      glance, with a start, toward the marble bridges, finally turning back to
      the remaining boxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened one of these&mdash;it was of yellow lacquer richly ornamented&mdash;and
      drew out what appeared to be a tangle of strings of pearls. He turned it
      over in his hands; spread it out; felt his pockets; finally unbuttoned his
      shirt and thrust it in there.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this point that Dixie arose, replaced the green tablets in her
      pocket, smoothed her skirt, and went lightly down the steps. He did not
      hear her until she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think Tom'll come back, Tex?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He whirled so clumsily that he nearly fell among the boxes and the broken
      and trampled bits of gold and silver; fixed his good eye on her, while the
      other, of glass, gazed vacantly over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      She coolly studied him&mdash;the flushed face, bulging pockets, protruding
      shirt where he had stuffed in those astonishing ropes of pearls.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said then, vaguely: &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought I'd come along. Suppose he stays back there&mdash;drinks some
      more. You'd be sort of up against it, wouldn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd be no worse off than you.&rdquo; He was evasive, and more than a little
      sullen. She saw that he was foolishly trying to keep his broad person
      between her and the boxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn't handle the junk without Tom. Not very well.... Look here,
      Tex, it can't be very far to the concessions at Hankow. We could pick up a
      cart, or even walk it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What good would that do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There'll be steamers down to Shanghai.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there'll be police to drag us off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can they? What can they pin on you?&rdquo; Connor's eye wavered back toward
      the grove and the buildings. He was again breathing hard. &ldquo;After all
      this..&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;That old viceroy'll be up here, you know. With his
      mob, too. And there's plenty of people here to tell....&rdquo; He was trying now
      to hold an arm across his middle in a position that would conceal the
      treasure there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her glance followed the motion, and for a moment a faintly mocking smile
      hovered about her thin mouth. She said: &ldquo;Saving those pearls for me, Tex?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her, fixed her with that one small eye, but offered not a
      word. A moment later, however, nervously signaling her to be still he
      brushed by and peeped out around the quinces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked quickly; then moved to his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately beyond the farthest of the marble bridges stood a group of ten
      or twelve soldiers in drunkenly earnest argument. Above them towered the
      powerful shoulders and small round head of Tom Sung. In the one quick
      glance she caught an impression of rifles slung across sturdy backs, of
      bayonets that seemed, at that distance, oddly dark in color; an
      impression, too, of confused minds and a growing primitive instinct for
      violence. Tom and another swayed toward the bridge; others drew them back
      and pointed toward the buildings they had left. The argument waxed. Voices
      were shrilly emphatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks bad,&rdquo; said the girl at Connor's shoulder. &ldquo;You've let 'em get out
      of hand, Tex.&rdquo; Then, as she saw him nervously measuring with his eye the
      width of the open space between the quinces and the gate screen, she
      added, &ldquo;Thinking of making a run for it, Tex?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He slowly swung that eye on her now; and for no reason pushed her roughly
      away. &ldquo;It's none of your business what I'm going to do,&rdquo; he replied
      roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the voice was husky, and curiously light in quality. And the eye
      wavered away from her intent look. This creature fell far short of the Tex
      Connor of old. She spoke sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come up into this summer-house, Tex!&rdquo; she indicated it with an upward
      jerk of her head. &ldquo;They won't see us there, at first. You didn't see me.
      You've got your pistols. You can give me one. We ought to be able to stand
      off a few Chinese drunks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could see that he was fumbling about for courage, for a plan, in a
      mind that had broken down utterly. His growl of&mdash;&ldquo;I'm not giving you
      any pistol!&rdquo;&mdash;was the flimsiest of cover. And so she left him,
      choosing a moment when that loud argument beyond the bridges was at its
      height to run lightly up the steps and into the pavilion.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this point she looked down on the thick-minded Connor as he struggled
      between cupidity, fear and the bluffing pride that was so deep a strain in
      the man. The one certain fact was that he couldn't purposelessly wait
      there, with Tom Sung leading these outlawed soldiers to a deed he feared
      to undertake alone.... They were coming over the bridges now, Tom in the
      lead, lurching along and brandishing his revolver, the others unslinging
      their rifles. The argument had ceased; they were ominously quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dixie got her tablets out again; then sat waiting, that faint mocking
      smile again touching the corners of her mouth. But the smile now meant an
      excitement bordering on the thrill she had lately envied the savage folk
      in the grove. Such a thrill had moved those coldeyed women who sat above
      the combat of gladiators in the Colosseum and with thumbs down awaited the
      death agony of a fallen warrior. It had been respectable then; now it was
      the perverse pleasure of a solitary social outcast. But to this girl who
      could be moved by no simple pleasure it came as a gratifying substitute
      for happiness. Her own danger but added a sharp edge to the exquisite
      sensation. It was the ultimate gamble, in a life in which only gambling
      mattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connor was fumbling first at a hip pocket where a pistol bulged, then at a
      side pocket that bulged with precious stones. His eye darted this way and
      that his cheeks had changed in color to a pasty gray. The girl thought for
      a moment that he had actually gone out of his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      His action, when it finally came, was grotesquely romantic. She thought,
      in a flash, of the adventure novels she had so often seen him reading. It
      was to her absurd; even madly comic. For with those bulging pockets and
      that gray face, a criminal run to earth by his cruder confederates, he
      fell back on dignity. He strode directly out into the path, with a sort of
      mock firmness, and, like a policeman on a busy corner, raised his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even at that he might have impressed the soldiers; for he was white, and
      had been their vital and vigorous leader, and they were yellow and
      low-bred and drunk. As it was, they actually stopped, just over the
      nearest bridge; gave the odd appearance of huddling uncertainly there. But
      Connor could not hold the pose. He broke; looked wildly about; started,
      puffing like a spent runner, up the steps of the pavilion where the girl,
      leaning slightly forward, drawing in her breath sharply through parted
      lips, looked through the leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several of the rifles cracked then; she heard bullets sing by. And Connor
      fell forward on the steps, clawed at them for a moment, and lay still in a
      slowly widening pool of thick blood. He had not so much as drawn a weapon.
      Tex Connor was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came on, laughing, with a good deal of rough banter, and gathered up
      the jewels. Tom and another mounted the steps to the body and went through
      the pockets of his trousers for the jewels that were there and the
      pistols. As there was no coat they did not look further. And then,
      merrily, they went back over the marble bridges to the buildings in the
      grove where were still, perhaps, liquor and women.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the last of their shouts had died out, when laying her head against
      the fragrant wood she could hear again the musical tinkling of the bronze
      bells and the pleasant murmuring of the tiny waterfall and the sighing of
      the leaves, Dixie slipped down to the body, fastidiously avoiding the
      blood. It was heavy; she exerted all her wiry strength in rolling it
      partly over. Then, drawing out the curious net of pearls she let the body
      roll back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning to her sheltered seat she spread on her lap the amazing garment;
      for a garment of some sort it appeared to be. There was even a row of
      golden clasps set with very large diamonds. At a rough estimate she
      decided that there were all of three thousand to four thousand perfect
      pearls in the numerous strings. Turning and twisting it about, she hit on
      the notion of drawing it about her shoulders and found that it settled
      there like a cape. It was, indeed, just that&mdash;a cape of pearls. She
      did not know that it was the only garment of its precise sort in the
      world, that it had passed from one royal person to another until, after
      the death of the Old Buddha in 1908 it fell into the hands of his
      excellency, Kang Yu.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took it off; stood erect; pulled out her loosely hanging middy blouse;
      and twisting the strings into a rope fastened it about her waist,
      rearranging the blouse over it. The concealment was perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat again, then, to think out the next step. Returning to the junk was
      cut of the question. It would be better to get somehow up to the
      concessions and trust to her wits to explain her presence there. For Tex
      had been shrewd enough about that. The concessions were a small bit of
      earth with but one or two possible hotels, full of white folk and fuller
      of gossip. She had had her little difficulties with the consuls as with
      the rough-riding American judge who took his itinerant court from port to
      port announcing firmly that he purposed ridding the East of such &ldquo;American
      girls&rdquo; as she. Dawley Kane would surely be there, and other survivors of
      the fire.... It all meant picking up a passage down the river at the
      earliest possible moment; and running grave chances at that. But her great
      strength lay in her impregnable self-confidence. She feared herself least
      of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another problem was the getting to the concessions. It was not the best of
      times for a girl to walk the highway alone. To be sure, she had come
      safely through from the junk; but it had not been far, and she hadn't had
      to approach a native army. She decided to wait an hour or so, until the
      plunderers there in the grove should be fully drunk; then, if at the
      moment it seemed the thing, to slip out and make a try for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, a little later, evidently from the road outside the wall, came a
      new sort of confused sounds; music, of flageolets and strings, and
      falsetto voices, and with it a low-pitched babel of many tongues. Whoever
      these new folk might be, they appeared to be turning in at the open gate.
      The music stopped abruptly, in a low whine of discord, and the talk rose
      in pitch. Over the brick screen appeared banners moving jerkily about,
      dipping and rising, as if in the hands of agitated persons below; a black
      banner, bearing in its center the triple imperial emblems of the Sun, the
      other two yellow, one blazoning the familiar dragon, the other a phoenix.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few banner men appeared peeping cautiously about the screen; Manchu
      soldiers of the old effete army, bearing short rifles. They came on,
      cautiously into the park, joined in a moment by others. An officer with a
      queue and an old-fashioned sword and a military cap in place of a turban
      followed and, forming them into a ragged column of fours, marched them
      over the marble bridges and into the grove, where they disappeared from
      view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a gorgeously colored sedan chair came swaying in, carried by many
      bearers walking under stout bamboo cross-poles. Others, in the more
      elaborate dress of officials, walked beside and behind it. Then came more
      soldiers, who straggled informally about, some even dropping on the gravel
      to rest their evidently weary bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chair was opened in front and a tall fat man stepped rather pompously
      out, wearing a robe of rose and blue and the brightly embroidered insignia
      and button of a mandarin of the fourth rank. At once a servant stepped
      forward with a huge umbrella which he opened and held over the fat man.
      And then they waited, all of them, standing or lying about and talking in
      excited groups. Several of the officials hurried back around the screen as
      if to examine the deserted apartments just within the gate, and shortly
      returned with much to say in their musical singsong.... An officer espied
      the body of Connor lying on the steps of the pavilion, and came with
      others, excitedly, to the foot of the steps. The key of the confused talk
      rose at once. There was an excited conference of many ranks about the tall
      fat man under the umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came, from the grove, that same sound of muffled shots, followed by a
      breathless pause. More shots then, and increasing excitement here by the
      screen. A number of the soldiers who had crossed the bridges appeared,
      running. The man in the lead had lost turban and rifle; as he drew near
      blood could be seen on his face. And now, abruptly, the officials and the
      ragtag and bobtail by the screen&mdash;pole-bearers, lictors, runners,
      soldiers&mdash;lost their heads. Some ran this way and that, even into the
      bushes, only to reappear and follow their clearer-headed brethren out to
      the gate. The umbrella-bearer dropped his burden and vanished. The
      fugitives from the grove were among the panic-stricken group now, racing
      with them for the gate and the highway without; scurrying around the end
      of the screen like frightened rabbits; and in pursuit, cheering and
      yelling, came many of the soldiers from the junk.
    </p>
    <p>
      They caught the tall fat mandarin, as he was waddling around the screen,
      wounded by a chance shot; leaped upon him, bringing him down screaming
      with fear; beat and kicked him; with their knives and bayonets performing
      subtle acts of torture which gave them evident pleasure and of which the
      coldly observant Dixie Carmichael lost no detail. When the fat body lay
      inert, not before, they took the sword of a fallen officer and cut off the
      head, hacking clumsily. The head they placed on a pole, marching noisily
      about with it; finally setting the pole upright beside the first of the
      little marble bridges. Then, at last, they wandered back into the grove
      and left the grisly object on the pole to dominate obscenely the garden
      they had profaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dixie leaned against the smooth sweet surface of the nanmu wood and
      listened, again, to the pleasantly soft sounds of waterfall and moving
      leaves and little bronze bells. Her face was chalk white; her thin hands
      lay limp in her lap; she knew, with an abrupt sensation of sinking, that
      she was profoundly tired. But in her brain burned still a cold white flame
      of excitement. Life, her instinct as the veriest child had informed her,
      was anything, everything, but the simple copybook pattern expounded by the
      naive folk of America and England. Life, as she critically saw it, was a
      complex of primitive impulses tempered by greeds, dreams and amazing
      subtleties. It was blindly possessive, carelessly repellent, creative and
      destructive in a breath, at once warm and cold, kindly and savage,
      impersonally heedless of the helpless human creatures that drifted hither
      and yon before the winds of chance. Cunning, in the world she saw about
      her, won always further than virtue, and often further than force.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not take her eyes, during a long period, from the hideous object
      on the pole. Her over-stimulated thoughts were reaching quickly, sharply,
      far in every direction. The feeling came, grew into belief, that she was,
      mysteriously, out of her danger. She felt the ropes of pearls under her
      blouse with an ecstatic little catch of the breath; and (finally) letting
      her eyes drop to that other ugly object on the steps beneath her, slowly
      opened her bag, drew out the bracelet watch (that the Manila Kid had given
      her out of an absurd hope) and fastened it about her wrist. And her eyes
      were bright with triumph.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X&mdash;YOUTH
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HERE came for his
      excellency, as the sun mounted the sky, a large junk of his own river
      fleet&mdash;great brown sails flapping against the five masts of all
      heights that pointed up at crazily various angles, pennons flying at each
      masthead, hull weathered darkly, mats and fenders of woven hemp hung over
      the poop-rail, and a swarming pigtailed crew at the sweeps and overside on
      the spunson and hard at the tracking ropes as the <i>tai-kung</i> screamed
      from the bow and the <i>laopan</i> shouted from the poop.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were ferried aboard in the small boat, Kang with his daughters and
      his suite and servants, a handful of pitifully wailing women, young Kane
      and Griggsby Doane. Then the trackers cast off from the shore and the
      mooring poles, the sweeps moved, and with the <i>lao pan</i> musically
      calling the stroke the junk moved laboriously up-stream toward the home of
      his excellency's ancestors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crowded into the uninviting cabins the weary travelers sought a few hours
      of rest. Even the servants and the mourning women, under the mattings
      forward, fell swiftly asleep. Only Rocky Kane, his eyes staring widely out
      of a sensitively white face, walked the deck; until the thought&mdash;a
      new sort of thought in the life of this headstrong youth&mdash;that he
      would be disturbing those below drove him aft, out beyond the steersman to
      the over-hanging gallery. Here he sat on the bamboo rail and gazed moodily
      down at the tireless, mighty river flowing off astern.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good in the boy&mdash;made up of the intelligence, the deep-smoldering
      conscience, the fineness that were woven out of his confused heritage into
      his fiber&mdash;was rising now like a tide in his spirit; and the
      experience was intensely painful. It seemed to his undisciplined mind that
      he was, in certain of his aspects, an incredible monster. There had been
      wild acts back home, a crazy instinct for excess that now took on
      distinctness of outline; moments of careless evil in Japan and Shanghai;
      the continuous subtle conflict with his father in which any evasion had
      seemed fair; but above all these vivid memory-scenes that raced like an
      uncontrollably swift panorama through his over-alert brain stood out his
      vicious conduct on the ship. It was impossible at this moment to realize
      mentally that the Princess Hui Fei was now his friend; he could see her
      only in the bright Manchu costume as she had appeared when he first so
      uncouthly spoke to her. And there were, too, the ugly moments with the
      strange girl known as Dixie Carmichael. That part of it was only a
      nightmare now.... The racing in his brain frightened him. He stared at the
      dimpling yellow river, at a fishing boat, and finally lifted his hurt eyes
      to the bright sky.... He had been going straight to hell, he told himself,
      mumbling the words softly aloud. And then this lovely girl had brought him
      into confusion and humility. Suddenly he had broken with his father; that,
      in itself, seemed curiously unaccountable, yet there the fact stood....
      Life&mdash;eager, crowding&mdash;had rushed him off his feet. He felt
      wildly adrift, carried on currents that he could not stem.... He was,
      indeed, passing through one of life's deepest experiences, one known to
      the somewhat unimaginative and intolerant people whose blood ran in his
      veins as conviction of sin. His own careless life had overtaken and
      confronted him. It had to be a bitter moment. There was terror in it. And
      there was no escaping; it had to be lived through.
    </p>
    <p>
      A merry voice called; there was the patter of soft-clad feet, and in a
      moment the little princess in her yellow hood with the fox head on the
      crown was climbing into his lap. Eagerly, tenderly, he lifted her; cuddled
      her close and kissed her soft cheek. Tears were frankly in his eyes now.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed with her, nervously at first, then, in the quick responsiveness
      of youth, with good humor. She came to him as health. Together they
      watched the diving cormorants and the wading buffalo. Then he hunted about
      until he found a bit of board and a ball of twine; whittled the board into
      a flat boat, stuck a little mast in it with a white sail made from a
      letter from his pocket, and towed it astern. Together they hung on the
      rail, watching the craft as it bobbed over the little waves and laughing
      when it capsized and lost its sail.
    </p>
    <p>
      She climbed into his lap again after that, and scolded him for making the
      unintelligible English sounds, and made signs for him to smoke; and he
      showed her his water-soaked cigarettes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a low-pitched exclamation he turned with a nervous start. The tall
      eunuch stood on the cabin roof; came quickly forward for the child. And
      beside him was Miss Hu Fei, still of course wearing the Chinese coat and
      trousers in which she had escaped from the steamer. She had, under the
      warm sun, thrown aside the curiously modern opera wrap. She was slim,
      young, delicately feminine. The boy gazed at her reverently. She seemed to
      him a fairy, an unearthly creature, worlds beyond his reach. In his
      excitement, but a few hours back&mdash;in what he had supposed to be their
      last moment together, in what, indeed, had seemed the end of the world&mdash;he
      had declared his love for her. That had been an uprush of pure emotion....
      He recalled it now, yet found it difficult to accept as an occurrence. The
      actual world had turned unreal to him, as it does to the sensitively young
      that suffer poignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this grave young woman, oddly his shipmate, he could hardly, he felt
      now, have spoken a personal word. Their acquaintance had begun at a high
      emotional pitch; now it must begin again, normally. So it seemed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were looking for my li'l sister,&rdquo; she explained, and half turned. The
      eunuch had already disappeared with the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you sit out here&mdash;with me?&rdquo; He spoke hesitantly. &ldquo;That is,
      unless you are too tired to visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I coul'n' sleep,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly she came out on the gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There aren't any chairs,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Perhaps I could find&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don' mind.&rdquo; She sank to the floor; leaned wearily against the rail. He
      settled himself in a corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't sleep either. You see&mdash;Miss Hui&mdash;Miss Fei&rdquo;&mdash;he
      broke into a chuckle of embarrassment&mdash;&ldquo;honest I don't know what to
      call you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The unexpected touch of boyish good humor moved her nearly to a smile.
      Boyish he was, sitting with his feet curled up, stabbing at the deck with
      his jackknife, coatless, collarless, his thick hair tousled, blushing
      pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My frien's call me Hui,&rdquo; she replied simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;really! May I&mdash;If you would&mdash;of course I know that&mdash;but
      my friends call me Rocky. The whole thing is Rockingham Bruce Kane.
      But....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll call you Misser Kane,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face fell a very little; but quickly he recovered himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have wondered&mdash;I suppose it seems as if I've done a rather
      crazy thing&mdash;it <i>must</i> seem so...&rdquo; She murmured, &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Attaching myself to your party this way&mdash;-at such a difficult time.
      I know it was a pretty impulsive thing to do, but....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice trailed into silence. For a brief moment this wild act seemed,
      however different in its significance to himself, of a piece with his
      other wild acts. It was, perhaps, like all those, merely ungoverned
      egotism. Her voice broke sweetly in on this moment of gloomy reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We know tha' you woul' help us if you coul'. An' you were so won'erful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I only could help! You see when I spoke that way to you&mdash;I mean
      telling you I loved you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please! We won' talk abou' tha'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. We won't. Except just this. I was beside myself. But even then, or
      pretty soon afterward, I knew it was just plain selfishness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mus'n' say that, either. Please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;just this! Of course you don't know me. What you do know is all
      against me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have forgotten&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will never forget. But even if you were some day to like me more than
      you could now, I know it would take a long time. I've got to earn the
      right to be really your friend first. I'm going to try to do that. I've
      started all over&mdash;to-day&mdash;-my life, I mean. I'm just simply
      beginning again. There's a good long scrap ahead of me. That's all about
      that! But please believe that I've got a little sanity in me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm sure&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have. Jumping overboard like that, and swimming back to you&mdash;it
      wasn't just crazy impulse, like so many of the things I've done. You see,
      my father knows you and your father&mdash;yes, I mean the terrible trouble
      you're in. Oh, everything comes to him, sooner or later. All the facts.
      You have to figure on that, with the pater. He&mdash;well, he wanted me to
      stop thinking about you. He was afraid I'd be writing to you, or
      something. You see, he'd watched us talking there by the fire. And he told
      me about this&mdash;this dreadful thing. And then I had to come back.
      Don't you see? I couldn't go on, leaving you like this. Of course, it's
      likely enough I'm just in the way here&mdash;&rdquo; She was smiling wearily,
      pathetically, now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's this way,&rdquo; he swept impetuously on. &ldquo;Maybe I <i>can</i> help.
      Anyway, I've got to try. If your father&mdash;really&mdash;&rdquo; He saw the
      slight shudder that passed through her slender body, and abruptly checked
      the rapid flow of words. &ldquo;We've got to take care of you,&rdquo; he said, with
      surprising gravity and kindness. &ldquo;You'll have to get back with the white
      people. You mustn't be left with the yellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said she, the strength nearly gone from her voice. &ldquo;It always
      seems to me that I'm an American. Though sometimes I ge' confuse'. It isn'
      easy to think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm simply wearing you out. I mustn't. But just this&mdash;remember that I
      know all about it. I've broken with my father, for the present, and I'm
      happy about that. I have got some money of my own&mdash;quite a little.
      I've even got a wet letter of credit in my pocket. I had just sense enough
      last night to get it out of my coat. It's no good, of course, outside of
      the treaty ports, but it's there. I'm here to help. And I do want to feel
      that you'll call on me&mdash;for anything&mdash;and as for the rest of it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had thought himself unusually clear and cool, but at this point his
      voice clouded and broke. He glanced timidly at her, and saw that her eyes
      were full of tears. He had to look away then. And during a long few
      moments they sat without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the thought came, &ldquo;I'm here to help!&rdquo; It was a stirring thought. He
      had never helped, never in his life that he could remember. And yet the
      Kanes did things; they were strong men.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was moodily skipping his knife over his hand, trying to catch the point
      in the soft wood. Abruptly, with a surprising smile, he looked up and
      asked: &ldquo;Ever play mumbletepeg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her troubled eyes for an instant met his. He chuckled again in that boyish
      way. And she, nervously, chuckled too. That seemed good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's sort of hard to make the blade stick in this wood,&rdquo; he said eagerly.
      &ldquo;But we can do some of the things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Griggsbv Doane, too, was far from sleep. For that matter, he was of the
      strong mature sort that needs little, that can work long hours and endure
      severe strain without weakening. Moving aft over the poop he saw them,
      playing like two children, and stepped quietly behind the slanting short
      mast that overhung the steersman.
    </p>
    <p>
      They made a charming picture, laughing softly as they tossed the knife. It
      hadn't before occurred to him that young Kane had charm. Plainly, now, he
      had. And it was good for Hui Fei, in this hour of tragic suspense. Youth,
      of course, would call unto youth. That was the natural thing. He tried to
      force himself to see it in that light but he moved forward with a heavy
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The junk plowed deliberately against the current. The monotonous voice of
      the chanting <i>lao pan</i>, the rhythmical splash and creak of the
      sweeps, the syncopated continuous song of the crowded oarsman, an
      occasional warning cry from the tai-kung&mdash;these were the only sounds.
      Elsewhere, lying in groups about the deck, the castaways slumbered.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Doane knew that his excellency was awake, shut away in the <i>laopan's</i>
      cabin, for repeatedly he had heard him moving about. Once, through a thin
      partition, had come the sound of a chair scraping. It would mean that Kang
      was preparing his final papers. These would be painstakingly done. There
      would be memorials to the throne and to his children and friends, couched
      in the language of a master of the classics, rich in the literary
      allusions dear to the heart of the scholar, Manchu and Chinese alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane found a seat on a coil of the heavy tracking rope. His own part in
      the drama through which they were all so strangely living could be only
      passive. He would serve as he might. His little dream of personal
      happiness, with a woman to love and new strong work to be somehow begun,
      was wholly gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, foot by foot, the clumsy craft crept up the river. And strangely
      the scene held its peaceful, intensely busy character. Everywhere, as if
      there were no revolution, as if the old river had never known wreckage and
      bloodshed, the country folk toiled in the fields. Junks passed. Irrigating
      wheels turned endlessly. Fishermen sat patiently watching their cormorants
      or lowering and lifting their nets. A big English steamer came booming
      down, with white passengers out of bloody Hankow (the looting and burning
      of the native city must have been going on just then, before the
      reinforced imperial troops drove the republicans back across the river).
      They layabout in deck chairs, these white passengers; or, doubtless,
      played bridge in the smoking-room. And Doane, as so often during his long
      life, felt his thoughts turning from these idle, self-important whites,
      back to the oldest of living peoples; and he dwelt on their incalculable
      energy, their incredible numbers, their ceaseless individual struggle with
      the land and water that kept them, at best, barely above the line of mere
      sustenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was difficult, pondering all this, to believe that any revolution could
      deeply stir this vast preoccupied people, submerged as they appeared to be
      in ancient habit. The revolution could succeed only if the Manchu
      government was ready to fall apart from the weakness of sheer decadence.
      It was nothing, this revolution, but the desperate work of agitators who
      had glimpsed the wealth and the individualistic tendencies of the West.
      And the hot-blooded Cantonese, of course. Most of the Chinese in America
      were Cantonese. The revolution was, then, a Southern matter; it was these
      tropical men that had come to know America. That was about its only
      strength. The great mass of yellow folk here in the Yangtze Valley, and
      through the coast provinces, and all over the great central plain and the
      North and Northwest were peaceable at heart; only those Southerners were
      truculent, they and the scattered handfuls of students.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, China, in the hopeful hearts of those who knew and loved the old
      traditions, must somehow be modernized. Sooner or later the Manchus would
      fall. The vast patient multitude must then either learn to think for
      themselves in terms of modern, large-scale organization or fall into
      deeper degradation. The European trading nations would strike deep and
      hard in a sordid struggle for the remaining native wealth. The Japanese,
      with iron policy and intriguing hand would destroy their institutions and
      bring them into a pitiful slavery, economic and military.
    </p>
    <p>
      His own life, Doane reflected, must be spent in some way to help this
      great people. The individual, confronted by so vast a problem, seemed
      nothing. But the effort had to be made. Since he was not a trader, since
      he could not hope now to find himself in step with the white generation
      that had passed him by, all that was left was to pitch in out here. The
      call of the martyred Sun Shi-pi pointed a way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The personal difficulty only remained. The man who loses step with his own
      people and his own time must submit to being rolled under and trampled on.
      There is no other form of loneliness so deep or so bitter. And seeing
      nothing above and about him but the hard under side of this hard white
      civilization, the unfortunate one can not hope to retain in full vigor the
      incentive to effort that is the magic of the creative white race. Every
      circumstance now seemed combined to hold him down and under. The
      philosophy of the East with which his spirit was saturated argued for
      contemplation, submission, negation (as did, for that matter, the gospel
      of that Jesus to whose life the peoples that called themselves Christian,
      in their every activity, every day, gave the lie). His only driving power,
      then, must come out of the white spark that was, after all, in his blood.
      It was only as a discordantly active white that he could help the yellow
      men he loved.... And the one great incentive&mdash;love, companionship,
      for which his strong heart hungered&mdash;had flickered before him only to
      die out. He must somehow, at that, prove worthy. It was to be just one
      more great effort in a life of prodigiously wasted effort.... He thought,
      as he had thought before, in bitter hours, of Gethsemane. But he knew,
      now, that he purposed going on. Once again he was to dedicate his vigor to
      a cause; but this time without the hope of youth and without love walking
      at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, quaintly, alluringly, the picture of Hui Fei took form before
      his mind's eye, as if to mock his laborious philosophy, charm it away.
      Like that of a boy his quick imagination wove about her bright youth, her
      piquant new-old worldliness, shining veils of illusion. It was, then, to
      be so. He was to live on, sadly, with a dream that would not die.... He
      bowed his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their play brought relief to the overwrought nerves of the two young
      people. After a time they settled comfortably against the rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lost all your things on the steamer?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Ever'thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So did I.&rdquo; He smiled ruefully. &ldquo;Even part of my clothes. But it doesn't
      matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I di'n' like to lose all my pretty things.&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;But they're gone
      now. All excep' my opera cloak. An' I'm jus' a Manchu girl again. It's so
      strange&mdash;only yes'erday it seem' to me I was a real American. I los'
      my books, too&mdash;all my books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced up quickly. &ldquo;You're fond of reading?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. Aren' you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;no, I haven't been. The fellows and girls I've known didn't
      read much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tha' seems funny. When you have so much. And it's so easy to read
      English. Chinese is ver' hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What books have you read mostly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled. &ldquo;Oh, I coul'n' say. So many! I've read the classics, of course&mdash;Shakespeare
      an' Milton and Chaucer. Chaucer is so modern&mdash;don' you think? I mean
      the way he makes pictures with words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you think,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if I confessed that I cut all those old
      fellows at school and college?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've thought often,&rdquo; said she gravely, &ldquo;tha' you Americans are spoil'
      because you have so much. So much of everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps. I don't know. The fellows feel that those things don't help much
      in later life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bu' they <i>do!</i> You mus' have a knowledge of literature an'
      philosophy. Wha' do they go to college for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; Inwardly, he winced. He felt himself, without resentment,
      without the faintest desire to defend the life he had known, at a
      disadvantage. &ldquo;To tell the truth, I suppose we go partly for a good time.
      It puts off going into business four years, you know, and once you start
      in business you've got to get down to it. Then there's all the athletics,
      and the friends you make. Of course, most of the fellows realize that if
      they make the right kind of friendships it'll help, later, in the big
      game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean with the sons of other rich men?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, not&mdash;yes, come to think of it, I suppose that's just what I
      do mean. Do you know here with you, it doesn't look like much of a picture&mdash;does
      it?&rdquo; Thoughtfully she moved her head in the negative. &ldquo;I know a goo' deal
      about it,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I've watch' the college men in America. Some of
      them, I think, are pretty foolish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose we are,&rdquo; said he glumly. &ldquo;But would you have a fellow just go
      in for digging?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She inclined her head. &ldquo;I woul'. It is a grea' privilege to have years for
      study.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was flushing. &ldquo;But you're not a dig! You&mdash;you dance, you know
      about things, you can wear clothes....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don' think study is like work to me. I love it. An' I love people&mdash;every
      kin', scholars, working people&mdash;you know, every kin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His moody eyes took in her eagerly mobile face; then dropped, and he
      stabbed his knife at the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, we know that all is no' right 'n America. The men of money
      have too much power. The govemmen' is confuse', sometimes very weak and
      foolish. The newspapers don' tell all the things they shoul'. But it is so
      healthy, jus' the same! There is so much chance for ever' kin' of idea to
      be hear'! An' so many won'erful books! Often I think you real Americans
      don' know how' won'erful it is. You get excite' abou' little things. I
      love America. The women are free there. There is more hope there than
      anywhere else in the worl'. An' I wish China coul' be like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quit college,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You see, I've never looked at things as you
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bu' you have such a won'erful chance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. And I've wasted it. But I'm changing. I&mdash;it wouldn't be fair
      of course to talk about&mdash;about what I was talking about&mdash;not now&mdash;but
      I am seeing things&mdash;everything&mdash;through new eyes. They're your
      eyes. I'm going at the thing differently. You see, the Kanes, when you get
      right down to it, don't think about anything but money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like to think about beauty,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if I could do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why no'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;it's kind of a new idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; she reached out, plainly without a personal thought, and took
      his hand. &ldquo;I'm going to reci' some poetry that I love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thrilled by the clasp of her hand, his mind eager wax to the impress of
      her stronger mind, his gaze clinging to her pretty mouth, he listened
      while she repeated the little poem of W. B. Yeats beginning:=
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the words that I utter,
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the words that I write..."=
    </p>
    <p>
      At first he stirred restlessly; then watching, doglike, fell to listening.
      The disconcerting thing was that it could mean so much to her. For it did&mdash;her
      dark eyes were bright, and her chin was uplifted. Her quaint accent and
      her soft, sweet voice touched his spirit with an exquisite vague pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is music,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see how you remember it all,&rdquo; said he listlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jus' the soun's. Oh, it woul' be won'erful to make words do that. So
      often I wish I ha' been born American, so it woul' be my language too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went on, breathlessly, with Yeats's&mdash;=
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you are old and gray and full of sleep..."=
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, still in pensive vein, she took up Kipling's <i>L'Envoi</i>&mdash;the
      one beginning&mdash;&ldquo;There's a whisper down the field.&rdquo; Clearly she felt
      the sea, too; and the yearning of those wandering souls to whom life is a
      wistful adventure, and the world an inviting labyrinth of beautiful hours.
      She seemed to know the <i>Child's Garden of Verses</i> from cover to
      cover, and other verse of Stevenson's. It was all strange to him, except
      &ldquo;In winter I get up at night.&rdquo; He knew that as a song.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it came about that on a dingy Yangtze junk, at the feet of a Manchu
      girl from America, Rocky Kane felt for the first time the glow and thrill
      of finely rhythmical English.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went on, almost as if she had forgotten him. William Watson's <i>April,
      April</i> she loved, she said, and read it with a quick feeling for the
      capricious blend of smiles and tears. It dawned on him that she was a born
      actress. He did not know, of course, that the theatrical tradition lies
      deeper in Manchu and Chinese culture than in that of any Western people.
    </p>
    <p>
      She recited the beautiful <i>Song</i> of Richard Le Galliene, beginning:=
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She's somewhere in the sunlight strong...."=
    </p>
    <p>
      And followed this with bits from Bliss Carman, and other bits from
      Henley's <i>London Nocturnes</i>, and from Wilfred Blunt and Swinburne and
      Mrs. Browning. She had a curiously strong feeling for the color of
      Medieval Italy. She spoke reverently of Dante. Villon she knew, too, and
      Racine and the French classicists. She even murmured tenderly de Musset's
      <i>J'ai dis à mon coeur</i>, in French of which he caught not a word and
      was ashamed. For he had cut French, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, as the sun mounted higher and the gentle rush of the river along
      the hull and the continuous chantey of the oarsmen floated, more and more
      soothingly to their ears, they fell quiet, her hand still pleasantly in
      his. Together they hummed certain of the current popular songs, he
      thinking them good, she smiling not unhappily as her voice blended
      prettily with his. And Griggsby Doane heard them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she murmured: &ldquo;I think I coul' rest now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad,&rdquo; said he, and drew down a coil of rope for a pillow, and left
      her sleeping there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane heard his step, but for a moment could not lift his head. Finally
      the boy, standing respectfully, spoke his name: &ldquo;Mr. Doane!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I sit here with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got to talk to somebody. It's so strange. You see, she and I&mdash;Miss
      Hui Fei&mdash;it's all been such a whirl I couldn't think, but....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That sentence never got finished. The boy dropped down on the deck and
      clasped his knees. Doane, very gravely, considered him. He was young,
      fresh, slim. He had changed, definitely; a degree of quiet had come to
      him. And there could be no mistaking the unearthly light in his eyes. The
      love that is color and sunshine and exquisite song had touched and
      transformed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane could not speak. He waited. Young Kane finally brought himself with
      obvious, earnest effort in a sense to earth. But his voice was unsteady in
      a boyish way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Doane,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;do you believe in miracles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thoughtfully, deliberately, Doane bowed his great head. &ldquo;I am forced to,&rdquo;
       he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've seen men change&mdash;from dirty, selfish brutes, I mean, to
      something decent, worth while?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?.... But does it have to be religion?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can it be love? The influence of a woman, I mean&mdash;a girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might that not be more or less the same thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really think that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the great head bowed. And there was a long silence. Rocky broke it
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would tell me exactly how you feel about marriage between the
      races.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;really&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have observed a lot, all these years out here. And the pater
      tells me that you're an able man, except that you've sort of lost your
      perspective. He did tell me that he'd like to have you with him, if you
      could only bring yourself around to our ways.&rdquo; Rocky, even now, could see
      this only as a profound compliment. He rushed on: &ldquo;Oh, don't misunderstand
      me! She doesn't love me yet. How could she? I've got to earn the right
      even to speak of it again. But if I should earn the right&mdash;in time&mdash;tell
      me, could an American make her happy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid I can't answer that general question.&rdquo; But Rocky felt that he
      was kind. &ldquo;The pater says I'd be wrecking my life. He says she'd always be
      pulled two ways&mdash;you know! God! He seemed to think I had only to ask
      her, and she'd come. He doesn't understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Doane&mdash;&ldquo;I'm afraid he couldn't understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You feel that too? It's very perplexing. I know I've spoken carelessly
      about the Chinese and Manchus. I looked down on them. I did! But oh, if I
      could only make it clear to you how I feel now! If I could only express
      it! We've been talking a long time, she and I. I don't mind telling you
      I'm taking a pretty bitter lesson, right now. She knows so much. She has
      such fine&mdash;well, ideals&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you've noticed that!.... Well, I feel crude beside her. Of course, I
      am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;you are. Even more so than you can hope to perceive now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The youth winced; but took it. &ldquo;Well, suppose&mdash;just suppose that I
      might, one of these days, prove that I'm decent enough to ask her to be my
      wife.... Oh, don't think for a minute that I don't understand all it
      means. I do. I tell you I'm starting again. I'm going to fight it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is fine,&rdquo; said Griggsby Doane, and looked squarely, gravely, at the
      very young face. It was a white face, but good in outline; the forehead,
      particularly, was good. And the blue eyes now met his. &ldquo;I believe you will
      fight it out. And I believe you have it in you to win.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to try, Mr. Doane. But just suppose I do win. And suppose I win
      her. It's when I think of that, that I.... I'll put it this way&mdash;to
      my friends, to everybody in New York, she'd be an oddity. A novelty, not
      much more. You know what most of them would think, in their hearts. Either
      they'd make an exception in her case&mdash;partly on my account, at that&mdash;or
      else they'd look down on her. You know how they are about people that
      aren't&mdash;well, the same color that we are. Probably I couldn't live
      out here. The business is mainly in New York, of course. And she's such an
      enthusiastic American herself&mdash;she'd want to be there. Some, anyway.
      And she's got to be happy. She's like a flower to me, now; like an orchid.
      Oh, a thousand times more, but.... What could I do? How could I plan? Oh,
      I'd fight for her quick enough. But you know our cold rich Americans. They
      wouldn't let me fight. They'd just....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; said Doane. quietly but with an authority that Rocky felt, &ldquo;you
      can't plan that. You can do only one thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay here in China a year before you offer yourself to that lovely girl.
      Study the Chinese&mdash;their language, their philosophy, their art. A
      year will not advance you far, but it should be enough to show you where
      you yourself stand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A year....!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to what I am going to try to tell you. Listen as thoughtfully as
      you can. First I must tell you this&mdash;the Chinese civilization has
      been&mdash;in certain aspects still remains&mdash;the finest the world has
      known. With one exception, doubtless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What exception?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Grecian. You see, I have startled you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm still sort of bewildered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally. But try to think with me. The Chinese worked out their social
      philosophy long ago. They have lived through a great deal that we have
      only begun, from tribal struggles through conquest and imperialism and
      civil war to a sort of republicanism and a fine feeling for peace and
      justice. And then, when they had given up primitive desire for fighting
      they were conquered by more primitive Northern tribes&mdash;first the
      Mongols, and later the Manchus. The Manchus have been absorbed, have
      become more or less Chinese.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now a few more blunt facts that will further startle you. The Chinese
      are the most democratic people in the world. No ruler can long resist the
      quiet force of the scores of thousands of villages and neighborhoods of
      the empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are the most reasonable people in the world. You can no more judge
      them from the so-called Tongs in New York and San Francisco, made up of a
      few Cantonese expatriates, than you can judge the culture of England by
      the beachcombers of the South Seas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They developed, centuries before Europe, one of the finest schools of
      painting the world has so far known. There is no school of reflective,
      philosophical poetry so ripe and so fine as the Chinese. They have had
      fifty Wordsworths, if no Shakespeare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find Americans confusing them with the Japanese, whom they
      resemble only remotely. All that is finest in Japan&mdash;in art and
      literature&mdash;came originally from China.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take my breath away,&rdquo; said Rocky slowly. But he was humble about it;
      and that was good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But listen, please. What I am trying to make clear to you is that in old
      Central China&mdash;in Hang Chow, and along this fertile Yangtze Valley,
      and northwest through the Great Plain to Kai Feng-fu and Sian-fu in Shensi&mdash;where
      the older people flourished&mdash;germinated the thought and the art, the
      humanity and the faith, that have been a source of culture to half the
      world during thousands of years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you can not hope to understand this culture through Western eyes. For
      you will be looking out of a Western background. You must actually
      surrender your background. It is no good looking at a Chinese landscape or
      a portrait with eyes that have known only European painting. Can you see
      why? Because all through European painting runs the idea of copying nature&mdash;somehow,
      however subtly, however influenced by the nuances of color and light,
      copying. But the Chinese master never copied a landscape He studied it,
      felt it, surrendered his soul to it, and then painted the fine emotion
      that resulted. And, remember this, he painted with a conscious technical
      skill as fine as that of Velasquez or Whistler or Monet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The youth whistled softly. &ldquo;Wait, Mr. Doane, please.... the fact is,
      you're clean over my head. I&mdash;I don't know a thing about our
      painting, let alone theirs. You see I haven't put in much time at&mdash;&rdquo;
       He stopped. His smooth young brows were knit in the effort to think along
      new, puzzling channels. &ldquo;But she would understand,&rdquo; he added, honestly,
      softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly! She would understand. That is what I am trying to make clear to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you're sort of&mdash;well, overwhelming me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy.&rdquo; said Doane very kindly, &ldquo;you could go back home, enter business,
      marry some attractive girl of your own blood who thinks no more deeply
      than yourself, whose culture is as thinly veneered as your own&mdash;forgive
      me. I am speaking blunt facts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on. I'm trying to understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;And find happiness, in the sense that we so carelessly use the
      word. But here you are, in China, proposing to offer your life to a Manchu
      princess. You do seem to see clearly that there would be difficulties. It
      is true that our people crudely feel themselves superior to this fine old
      race. As a matter of fact, one of the worthiest tasks left in the world is
      to explain East to West&mdash;draw some part of this rich old culture in
      with our own more limited background. But as it stands now, the current
      will be against you. So I say this&mdash;study China. Open your mind and
      heart to the beauty that is here for the taking. Try to look through the
      decadent surface of this tired old race and see the genius that still
      slumbers within. If, then, you find yourself in the new belief that their
      culture is in certain respects finer than ours&mdash;as I myself have been
      forced to believe&mdash;if you can go to Hui Fei humbly&mdash;then ask her
      to be your wife. For then there will be a chance that you can make her
      happy. Not otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane stopped abruptly. His deep voice was rich with emotion. The boy was
      stirred; and a moment later, when he felt a huge hand on his shoulder he
      found it necessary to fight back the tears. The man seemed like a father;
      the sort of father he had never known.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't ask her so long as a question remains in your mind. Defiance won't
      do&mdash;it must be faith, and knowledge. I can't let you take the life of
      that girl into your keeping on any other terms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The odd emphasis of this speech passed quite by the deeply preoccupied
      young mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're right,&rdquo; he replied brokenly. &ldquo;I've got to wait. Everything that
      you say is true&mdash;I really haven't a thing in the world to offer. I'm
      an ignorant barbarian beside her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have the great gift of youth,&rdquo; said Doane gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a moment later Rocky broke out with: &ldquo;But, Mr. Doane&mdash;how can I
      wait? She&mdash;after her father&mdash;they're going to take her away&mdash;make
      her marry somebody at Peking&mdash;somebody she doesn't even know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think they will succeed in that plan,&rdquo; said Doane very soberly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why not? What can she do? A girl&mdash;alone&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are tens of thousands of girls in China that have solved that
      problem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't see&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must still try to keep your mind open. You are treading on ground
      unknown to our race.&rdquo; A breathless quality crept into Doane's voice; his
      eyes were fixed on the distant river bank. &ldquo;I wonder if I can help you to
      understand. Death&mdash;the thought of death&mdash;is to them a very
      different thing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; It was more a sharp indrawing of breath than an exclamation. &ldquo;You
      don't mean that she would do that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane bowed his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she couldn't do a cowardly thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane brought himself, with difficulty, to utter the blunt word. &ldquo;Suicide,
      in China, is not always cowardice. Often it is the finest heroism&mdash;the
      holding to a fine standard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! It wouldn't ever&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please! You are a Westerner. Your feelings are those of the younger&mdash;yes,
      the cruder half of the world. I must still ask you to try to believe that
      there can be other sorts of feelings.&rdquo; Again the great hand rested solidly
      on the young shoulder; and now, at last, the boy became slightly aware of
      the suffering in the heart of this older man. Though even now he could not
      grasp every implication. That human love might be a cause he did not
      perceive. But he sensed, warmly, the ripe experience and the compassionate
      spirit of the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have stepped impulsively into an Old-World drama,&rdquo; Doane went quietly
      on&mdash;&ldquo;into a tragedy, indeed. No one can say what the next
      developments will be. You can win, if at all, only by becoming yourself, a
      fatalist; You must move with events. Certainly you can not force them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can take her away,&rdquo; cried the boy hotly; finishing, lamely, with
      &ldquo;somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Against her will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;surely&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will not leave her father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;oh, Mr. Doane....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fell silent. For a long time they sat without a word, side by side.
      Here and there about the junk sleepers awoke and moved about. A few of the
      women, forward, set up their wailing but more quietly now. The craft
      headed in gradually toward the right bank, passing a yellow junk that was
      moored inshore and moving on some distance up-stream. At a short distance
      inland a brown-gray village nestled under a hillside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That junk passed us before we left the island,&rdquo; Rocky observed, gloomily
      making talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane's gaze followed his down-stream; then at a sound like distant
      thunder, he turned and listened. &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; asked the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane looked up into the cloudless, blazing sky. &ldquo;That would be the guns
      at Hankow,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lictors were landed first to seek carts in the village. Then all were
      taken ashore in the small boat. His excellency smilingly, with unfailing
      poise, talked with Doane of the beauties of the river; even quoted his
      favorite Li Po, as his quiet eyes surveyed the hills that bordered the
      broad river:=
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;'The birds have all flown to their trees,
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last, last lovely cloud has drifted off,
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we never tire in our companionship&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountains and I,'&rdquo;=
    </p>
    <p>
      The line of unpainted, springless carts, roofed with arched matting,
      yellow with the fine dust of the highway, moved, squeaking, off among the
      hills. Following close went the women and the servants. The junk swung
      deliberately out and off down the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane, declining a cart, walked beside that of his excellency; Rocky Kane,
      deadly pale, his mouth set firmly, beside Miss Hui Fei. And so, through
      the peaceful country-side they came to the long brick wall and the heavily
      timbered gate house by the road, and, pausing there, heard very faintly
      the soft tinkling of the little bronze bells within. It was late
      afternoon. The shadows were long; and the evening birds were twittering
      among the leafy branches just within the wall.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI&mdash;THE LANDSCAPE SCROLL OF CHAO MENG-FU
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>OCKY KANE, the few
      hours that followed were to exist in memory as a confused sequence of
      swift-pressing scenes, all highly colored, vivid; certain of them touched
      with horror, others passing in a flash of exotic beauty; while the fire of
      hot, unreasoning young love burned all but unbearably within his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would remember the crowded line of carts in the sunken narrow road, the
      unruly mules that plunged and entangled their harness; the huddled women;
      the yellow dust that clung thickly to the bright silks of the mandarins;
      the confusion about the gate, and the handful of soldiers that came
      hurrying forward to help in a strange business up there; the trains of
      other carts that struggled to pass in the narrow way, while tattered
      muleteers shouted a babel of invective.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would remember the sad face of Miss Hui Fei-drawn back within the
      shadow of the cart and the faint smiles that came and so quickly went; and
      the efforts he made, at first, to cheer her with boyishly bright talk of
      this and that.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would remember how he made his way forward through the press, without
      recalling what had just been said, or what, precisely, could have been the
      impulse driving him on; past his excellency&mdash;sitting yet in his cart,
      calmly waiting, while the drabbled mandarins stood respectfully by; and
      how he found the soldiers carrying oddly limp Bodies into one of the gate
      houses, hiding them there.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would remember the picture on which he stumbled as he rounded the inner
      screen of brick; Mr. Doane and an officer and two or three soldiers
      standing thoughtfully about a fat body in spattered silks that was
      hideously without a head; standing there in the half dusk&mdash;for the
      shadows were lengthening softly into evening here under the trees&mdash;Mr.
      Doane then bending over, the officer kneeling, to examine the embroidery
      on the breast; and then two soldiers bringing up a pole on the end of
      which grinned the missing head; and then the sound of his own voice&mdash;curiously
      breathless and without body, asking, &ldquo;What is it, Mr. Doane? What terrible
      thing has happened?&rdquo; And then, even while he was speaking, four soldiers
      carrying another body by, this of a stout man in shirt and flannel
      trousers, that he felt he had seen somewhere before.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would remember&mdash;when they had carried out the last awful reminder
      of the bloodshed that had been, and while Mr. Doane pressed a hand to his
      eyes as if in prayer&mdash;how he stood silent there on the gravel area,
      looking up into the trees and about at the dim quaint <i>pai-lows</i> on
      either hand and at the pavilions behind them, each on its arch of stone
      over placid dark water; and how the lightly moving air of evening
      whispered through the trees, stirring, with the foliage, faintly musical
      little bells; and how, into this moment of calm, appeared, light of step,
      swinging her shopping bag as she descended the marble steps of the
      pavilion at the right and came forward under the <i>pai-lows</i>, the pale
      girl, Dixie Carmichael, who glanced respectfully toward Mr. Doane, and at
      Rocky himself raised her black eyebrows while her thin lips softly framed
      the one word, &ldquo;You?&rdquo; And then, after a few words&mdash;the girl said that
      Tex Connor and the Manila Kid made her come; it had been a terrible
      business; she thought both must have been, killed; she had contrived to
      hide&mdash;how Mr. Doane asked him to take her back to the women; and how
      they went, he and she, his heart beating hotly, out through the darkening
      gate where paper lanterns now moved about. He felt that for the first
      sharp blow at his new life. There would be other blows; doubtless through
      this girl; for the old life would not give him up without a fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was to forget what they said, he and this unaccountable, cool girl, as
      he left her out there and hurried back; but would remember the picture he
      found on his return&mdash;Mr. Doane striding off deliberately into the
      darkness beyond the little white bridges, while the officer followed with
      a lantern, and the few soldiers, also with lanterns, straggled after. He
      would remember crowding himself past all of them, snatching one of the
      lanterns as he ran, and falling into step at the side of the huge
      determined man.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were broad courtyards, then, and buildings with heavily curving
      roofs and columns richly colored and carved, with dim lights behind
      windows of paper squares. There were drunken soldiers, who ran away, and
      screaming women, and other women who would never scream or smile again.
      There was litter and splintered furniture and a broken-in door here and
      there. There was a familiar big soldier who plunged at Mr. Doane with a
      glinting blade in his hand; and then a sharp struggle that was to last, in
      retrospect, but an instant of time, for the clearer memory was of himself
      binding with his handkerchief a small cut in Mr. Doane's forearm while the
      soldiers carried out a wounded struggling giant, and then shouts and shots
      from the courtyard when the giant escaped. And he would remember picking
      up an unset ruby from the tiling and handing it to Mr. Doane. There was
      the picture, then, of a melancholy procession winding slowly through the
      grove with bobbing gay lanterns.
    </p>
    <p>
      And finally, to the boy incredibly, the place came into a degree of order
      and calm. Women and men disappeared into this building and that. Rocky sat
      alone on the steps of a structure that might have been a temple, hands
      supporting his throbbing head. The moonlight streamed down into the
      courtyard; he could see the grotesque ornaments on the eaves of the
      buildings, and the large blue-and-white bowls and vases in which grew
      flowering plants and dwarfed trees from Japan, and, in the farther gate, a
      sentry lounging. Now and again faint sounds came from within the largest
      of the buildings, voices and footsteps; and he could see lights again
      dimly through the paper. He wondered what they might be doing.... His
      thoughts were a fever. The spirit of Hui Fei hovered like an exquisite
      dream there, but crowding in with malignant persistence came, kept coming,
      pictures of Dixie Carmichael. He wondered where they had put her. Perhaps
      she was already asleep. It would be like her to sleep. She was so cold, so
      oddly unhealthy. Doubtless, surely, he would have to speak with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must have dozed. Soldiers were dragging themselves sleepily about the
      courtyard, rifles in hand. Two officers and a mandarin in a gown were
      examining a paper by the light of a lantern. Then Mr. Doane came out and
      read the paper. They talked in Chinese, Mr. Deane's as fluent as theirs.
      Rocky thought drowsily about this; considered vaguely the years of study
      and experience that must lie back of that fluency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Doane, indeed, seemed to be assuming a sort of command. With great
      courtesy, but with impressive finality, he appeared to be outlining a
      course to which the mandarin assented. The officers bowed and went out
      through the gate. And when the mandarin and Doane then turned and entered
      the largest building it was the white man who held the paper in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rocky fell again into a doze; slept until he found Mr. Doane shaking him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me now. You can help.&rdquo; Thus the huge grave man with the deep
      shadows in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Rocky went with him, guided by a servant with a lantern, through
      corridors and courtyards, glimpsing dimly massive pillars and panels in
      black wood and softly red silk and railings of marble carved into
      exquisite tracery.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the paper that the boy had drowsily observed Doane sought his
      excellency. Dominated by the white man the attendant mandarin tapped at an
      inner door, then hesitatingly opened; and Doane alone stepped within.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was long, plain, obscurely seen by the light of a single
      incandescent lamp over the formal <i>kang</i> or platform across the
      farther end. Doane had not thought of electric light in here and found it
      momentarily surprising. The walls were paneled in silk; the ceiling was
      heavy with beams. Against either side wall, mathematically at the center,
      stood a square small table and a square stool, heavily carved. Seated on
      the <i>kang</i>, with papers spread about and brushes and ink pot directly
      under the light, in short quilted coat and simple black cap, was Kang; a
      serenely patient figure, quietly working. He had merely looked up; a frail
      old man, quite beyond the reach of annoyance, whose eyes gazed unafraid
      over the rim of mere personal life into the eternal, tireless energy that
      would so soon absorb all that was himself. Then, recognizing the stalwart
      figure that moved forward into the light, he rose and clasped his hands
      and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only an unexpected crisis would lead me to intrude thus,&rdquo; began Doane in
      Chinese, bowing in courtly fashion and clasping his own hands before his
      breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No visit from Griggsby Doane could be regarded as an intrusion in my
      home,&rdquo; replied his excellency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will speak quickly, in the Western fashion,&rdquo; Doane went on. &ldquo;His
      Excellency, the General Duke Ma Ch'un, commanding before Hankow, writes
      that he regrets deeply the violent death of the eunuch, Chang Yuan-fu on
      your excellency's premises while dutifully engaged on the business of her
      imperial majesty, and cordially requests that your excellency come at once
      to headquarters as his personal guest to assist him in making an inquiry
      into the tragedy. He supplements this invitation with a copy of a telegram
      from His Excellency, Yuan Shih-k'ai, commanding him to guard at once your
      person and property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The simple elderly man, who had been a minister, a grand councilor and a
      viceroy, seemed to recoil slightly as his eyes drooped to the papers about
      him; then he reached, with a withered hand that trembled, for this new
      paper and very slowly read it through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Excellency, Duke Ma Ch'un.&rdquo; Doane added gently, &ldquo;has sent a company
      of soldiers to escort you fittingly to his headquarters. They are waiting
      now at the outermost gate. I took it upon myself in this hour of sorrow
      and confusion to advise them, through the mouths of your loyal officers,
      that your excellency is not to be disturbed before dawn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, with an expressionless face, the viceroy folded the paper and laid
      it on the <i>kang</i>. He sank, then, beside it; with visible effort
      indicating that his visitor sit as well. But Doane remained standing&mdash;enormously
      tall, broad, strong; a man to command without question of rank or
      authority; a man, it appeared, hardly conscious of the calm power of
      personality that was so plainly his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Excellency is aware&rdquo;&mdash;thus Doane said&mdash;&ldquo;that to admit the
      authority of Duke Ma Ch'un at this sorrowful time is to submit both
      yourself and your lovely daughter to a fate that is wholly undeserved, one
      that I&mdash;if I may term myself the friend of both&mdash;can not bring
      myself to consider without indulging the wish to offer strong resistance.
      It has been said, 'The truly great man will always frame his actions with
      careful regard to the exigencies of the moment and trim his sail to the
      favoring breeze.' Your Excellency must forgive me if I suggest that,
      whatever value you may place upon your own life, we can not thus abandon
      your daughter, Hui Fei.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The viceroy's voice, when he spoke, had lost much of its timbre. It was,
      indeed, the voice of a weary old man. Yet the words came forth with the
      old kindly dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked you, Griggsby Doane, to make with me this painful journey to my
      home. We did not know then that we were moving from one scene of tragedy
      to another more terrible. But motive must not wait on circumstance. It
      need not be a hardship for my other children to live on in Asia as
      Asiatics. As such they were born. They know no other life. They will
      experience as much happiness as most. But with Hui Fei it is different.
      She must not be held away from contact with the white civilization. I did
      not give her this modern education for such an end as that. Hui Fei is an
      experiment that is not yet completed. She must have her chance. That is
      why I brought you here, Griggsbv Doane. My daughter must be got to
      Shanghai. There she has friends. I have ventured to count on your
      experience and good will to convey her safely there. Will you take her&mdash;now?
      To-night? I had meant to send with her the jewels and the paintings of
      Ming, Sung and Tang. Both collections are priceless. But the gems are gone&mdash;to-night.
      The paintings, however, remain. Will you take those and my daughter, and
      two servants&mdash;there are hardly more that I can trust&mdash;and slip
      out by the upper gate, and in some way escort her safely to Shanghai?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She would not go,&rdquo; said Doane. &ldquo;Not while you, Your Excellency, live, or
      while your body lies above ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The viceroy, hesitating, glanced up at the vigorous man who spoke so
      firmly, then down at the scattered papers on the <i>kang</i>. In the very
      calm of that shadowed face he felt the bewildering strength of the white
      race; and he knew in his heart that the man was not to be gainsaid. His
      mind wavered. For perhaps the first time in his shrewd, patiently subtle
      life, he felt the heavy burden of his years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will send for her,&rdquo; he said now, slowly. &ldquo;I will give her into your
      keeping. At my command she will <i>go</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Your Excellency, I have already sent word to her to prepare herself
      for the journey. Again you must forgive me. Time presses. It remains only
      to collect the paintings. You must have those, at the least. We start now
      in a very few moments. I have found here, a prisoner in your palace, the
      master of a junk that lies at the river bank, and have taken it upon
      myself to detain him further. He will convey us to Shanghai. It is now but
      a few hours before dawn. Hostile soldiers stand impatient at the outermost
      gate, eager to heap shame upon you and all that is yours. You must change
      your clothing&mdash;the dress of a servant would be best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waited, standing very still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will forgive indecision in a man of my years,&rdquo; began the viceroy.
      After a moment he began again: &ldquo;The world has turned upside down, Griggsby
      Doane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The viceroy sighed. Trembling fingers reached out to gather the papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come.&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrift in unreality, fighting off from moment to moment the drowsy sense
      that these strange events were but a blur of dreams in which nothing could
      be true, nothing could matter, Rocky found himself at work in a dim room,
      taking down in great handfuls from shelves scrolls of silk wound on rods
      of ivory and putting them in lacquered boxes. Mr. Doane was there, and the
      servant, and a second servant of lower class, in ragged trousers and with
      his queue tied about his head. Still another Chinese appeared, shortly, in
      blue gown and sleeveless short jacket; an older man who looked, in the
      flickering faint light of the single lantern, curiously like the viceroy
      himself. The first servant disappeared and returned with the short poles
      of bamboo used everywhere in China in carrying burdens over the shoulder,
      and with cords and squares of heavy cotton cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every bit of woodwork that his hands touched in moving about, Rocky found
      to be intricately carved and gilded and inlaid with smooth lacquer. And
      dimly, crowded about the walls, he half saw, half sensed, innumerable
      vases, small and large, with rounding surfaces of cream-colored crackle
      and blood-red and blue-and-white and green which threw back the moving
      light like a softly changing kaleidoscope. And there were screens that
      gave out, from their profound shadows, the glint of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      They packed the boxes together, wrapped the large and heavy cubes in the
      squares of cloth and lashed them to hang from the bamboo poles. Four of
      them, then, Mr. Doane, Rocky himself and the servants, each balanced a
      pole over his shoulders and lifted the bulky cubes. The old man, who
      surely, now, was the viceroy, carried a European hand-bag. There were
      other parcels.... They made their way along a nearly dark corridor and out
      into the moonlight. Here, in a porch, stood four silent figures&mdash;Dixie
      Carmichael he distinguished first; then Hui Fei, wearing a short coat and
      women's trousers and a loose cloak. Her hair was parted and lay smoothly
      on her pretty head, glistening in the moonlight.... And the little
      princess was there, clinging to the hand of her sister and rubbing her
      eyes. They moved silently on, all together, following a path that wound
      among shrubbery, over an arching bridge to a gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rocky could dimly see the timbers studded with spikes and the long hinges
      of bronze. The servant, with a great key, unlocked the gate, which closed
      softly behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pole weighed heavily on Rocky's unaccustomed shoulder. There was a
      trick of timing the step to the swing of the bales, that, stumbling a
      little, he caught. He was to remember this&mdash;the little file of men
      and women gathered from the two ends of the earth and walking without a
      spoken sound down through a twisting, sunken Chinese road to the Yangtze.
      And sensing the gathering drama of his own life, brooding over it with
      slowly increasing nervous intensity, he found himself coming awake. If
      this kept on he would soon be excitedly beyond sleep. But it didn't
      matter. They were saving Hui Fei. Not a word of explanation had been
      offered; but it was coming clear. As for the rest of it, he asked himself
      how it could matter. The presence of Miss Carmichael, a dangerous girl, an
      adventuress&mdash;he was thinking quite youthfully about her&mdash;who
      might easily be capable of anything, who could in a moment destroy the
      hope that was the only foundation, thus far, of his new life, and perhaps
      would choose to destroy it&mdash;even this, he tried to tell himself,
      couldn't possibly matter. Over and over, stumbling and shuffling along, he
      told himself that; almost convinced himself that he believed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was to remember most vividly of all the first glimpse, through a notch
      in the hills, of the river. The viceroy paused at that point, and turning
      back from the shining picture before him, where the moonlight silvered the
      unruffled surface of the water, toward the home of his ancestors over the
      hill, spoke in a low but again musical voice a few lines in which even the
      American youth could detect the elusive vowel rhymes of a Chinese poem.
      And he saw that Mr. Doane stood by with the slightly bowed head of one who
      attends a religious ceremony. It was a moving scene. But could he have
      understood the words the boy would have been puzzled. For the poem&mdash;the
      <i>Surrendering</i> of Po Chu-I. breathed resignation, humility, the
      negative philosophy so dear to Chinese tradition, but nothing of religion
      in the sense that he a Westerner, understood the word, nothing of
      mysticism or romantic illusion or childlike faith; rather a gentle
      recognition of the fact that life must go as it had come, unexplained,
      without tangible evidence of a personal hereafter; that, too, the
      individual is as nothing in the vast scheme of nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were ferried out, shortly after this, to the great junk they had
      twice seen within the twenty-four hours, her smooth sides curving yellow
      in the moonlight, her decks now scraped and scrubbed clean, flowers
      blooming in porcelain pots about a charming gallery that extended high
      over the river astern. The crew, roused from slumber, came swarming out
      from under the low-spread mattings. The <i>laopan</i> stepped nimbly to
      his post amidships on the poop. The heavy tracking ropes were hauled
      aboard, and the craft swung slowly off down the current.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane, with a lantern, escorted his excellency and Hui Fei, and the
      whimpering little princess, to the rooms below; then returned and with the
      same impersonal courtesy conducted Miss Carmichael down the steps. But at
      the door he indicated she stopped short; wavered a moment, lightly, on the
      balls of her feet. Then she accepted the lantern from him, bit her lip,
      and let fall the curtain without replying to his suggestion that she had
      better sleep if she could.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone there, she held up the lantern. The floor had been lately scrubbed;
      but, even so, she made out a faint broad stain in the wood. And a bed of
      clean matting was spread where she had left a grisly heap.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time Dixie stood by the square small window, looking out over the
      shining river toward the dim northern bank with its hills that seemed to
      drift at a snail's pace off astern. Her quick mind had never been farther
      from sleep. Her thin hands felt through her blouse the twisted ropes of
      pearls that were wound about her waist. Her lips were pressed tightly
      together. These pearls represented a fortune beyond even Dixie's
      calculating dreams. To keep them successfully hidden during the days,
      perhaps weeks to come of floating down the river in close companionship
      with these two strong observant men, and a half crazy American boy, and
      clever Oriental women, would test her resourcefulness and her nerve.
      Though she felt, ever, now, no doubt of the latter....
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing was tremendous. Now that the confusion of the day and night were
      over with, she found a thrill in considering the problem, while her
      sensitive fingers pressed and pressed again the hard little globes. There
      were so many of them; such beauties, she knew, in form and size and
      color.... Never again would such an opportunity come to her. It was,
      precisely, if on the grandest scale imaginable, her sort of achievement.
      Tex was gone. The Kid was gone. No one could claim a share or a voice: it
      was all hers&mdash;wealth, power, even, perhaps, at the last, something
      near respectability. For money, enough of it, she knew, will accomplish
      even that. While on the other, hand, to fail now, might, would, spell a
      life of drab adventure along the coast, without even a goal, without a
      decent hope; with, always, the pitiless years gaining on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She searched, tiptoeing, about the room, lantern in hand, for a place to
      hide her treasure; then reconsidered. In some way she must keep the pearls
      about her person; though not, as now, looped around her waist. An
      accidental touch there might start the fateful questioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put down the lantern; stood for a long time by the curtained door,
      listening. From up and down the passage came only the heavy breathing of
      exhausted folk. She slipped out cautiously; made her way to the sloping
      deck above&mdash;how vividly familiar it was!&mdash;tiptoed lightly aft,
      past the uncurious helmsman, around the huge coils of rope and the
      piled-up fenders of interwoven matting, out to the pleasant gallery where
      the flowers were.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, as she stepped down and paused to breathe slowly, deeply, again
      the heavy-sweet perfume of the tuberoses, a boyish figure sprang up, with
      a nervous little gasp of surprise, from the steamer chair of Hong Kong
      grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said, in her quiet way, &ldquo;Oh, hello!&rdquo; And then, with a quick sidelong
      glance at him, accepted the chair he offered. He seemed uncertain as to
      whether he would go or stay. Lowering her lids, she studied him. He was
      standing the excitement well, even improving. His carriage was better; he
      stood up well on his strong young legs. And he was quieter, better in
      hand, though of course the never-governed, long overstimulated emotions
      would not be lying very deep beneath this new, more manly surface. He was
      very good-looking, really a typical American boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood now, fingering the petals of a dahlia and gazing out astern into
      the luminous night. She pondered the question of exerting herself again to
      win him. The money was there, plenty of it. He would be as helpless as
      ever in her experienced hands. And the mere use of her skill in trapping
      and stripping him would be enjoyable.... He was lingering.
    </p>
    <p>
      She decided in the negative. He would surely become tempestuous. And as
      surely, if she permitted that, he would discover the pearls. And&mdash;again
      the thrill of mastery swept through her finely strung nerves&mdash;she had
      those. They were enough. But they must be better hidden. There was her
      problem still, a problem that aught at any instant become delicately
      acute. She considered it, lying comfortably back in the chair, luxuriating
      in the richly blended scent of the crowded blossoms, while her nearly
      closed eyes studied the restless boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abruptly he turned. What now? Was he about to become tempestuous all on
      his own? It would be anything but out of character. Her slight muscles
      tightened, but her face betrayed no emotion, would have betrayed none in a
      more searching light than this soft flood from the moon. He was
      sentimental over the Manchu princess, now, of course. She hadn't missed
      that. But in the case of an ungoverned boy, she well knew, the emotion
      itself could be vastly more important than its immediate object But now
      she was to meet with a small surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; he began, crude, naive, as always, &ldquo;there's something&mdash;perhaps&mdash;I
      ought to tell you. I tried to carry on with you. You've got a right to
      think anything about me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At least he was keeping his voice down. She lay still; let him talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;But I've changed. Smile at that, if you want to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did smile faintly, but only at his clear, clean ignorance of the
      insult that underlay his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;I <i>was</i> on the loose. It's different now. I'm going to try to
      do something with my life. Whatever happens&mdash;I mean however my luck
      may seem to turn&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could hardly go on with this. The next few words were swallowed down.
      It was plain enough that he couldn't think clearly. And he couldn't
      possibly know that he was giving her an opening through which, within a
      very few moments, she was to see the outline of the policy she must pursue
      during these difficult days to come on the junk.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her head; leaned on an elbow. &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she said, in a
      voice that seemed, now, to have a note of friendliness, &ldquo;I'm sorry for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't think I can't see how it is. And you mustn't misunderstand me. I'm
      older than you. I'm pretty experienced. My life has been hard. There
      couldn't be anything serious between you and me. You've wakened up to
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The new note in her voice puzzled him, but caught his interest. He stood
      looking straight down at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you're in love,&rdquo; she went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be silly. It's plain enough. She's very attractive. Nobody could
      blame you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's wonderful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's nice to see you feeling that way. It&mdash;it's no good our talking
      about it, you and me. All I've got to say is&mdash;please don't think I'd
      bother you. I may have led a rough life at times&mdash;a girl alone, who
      has to live by her wits&mdash;but&mdash;oh, well, never mind that! Every
      man has had his foolish moments. I understand you better than you will
      ever know&mdash;and&mdash;well, here's good luck!&rdquo; And she offered her
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took it, breathless, eager. He seemed, then, on the point of pouring
      out his story to this new surprising friend. But a slight sound caught his
      attention. He looked up, and slowly let fall the hand that was gripped in
      his; for at the break of the deck, just above them, hesitating, very slim
      and wan, stood Miss Hui Fei.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation was, of course, in no way so dramatic as it seemed to the
      boy. He, indeed, drew back, overcome; the habit of guilty thought was not
      to be thrown off in a moment. Miss Carmichael, sensing that he would begin
      erecting the incident into a situation the moment he could clumsily speak,
      took the matter in hand; rising, and quietly addressing herself to the
      Manchu girl. Breeding, of course, was not hers, could not be; but her calm
      manner and her instinct for reticence could seem, as now, not unlike the
      finer quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do have this chair,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was going down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Hui Fei smiled faintly. &ldquo;I coul'n' sleep,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's one little article I suppose none of us thought to bring&mdash;&rdquo;
       thus Miss Carmichael, balancing in her light way on the balls of her feet&mdash;&ldquo;needle
      and thread.&rdquo; She even indulged in a little passing laugh. &ldquo;I think my maid&mdash;&rdquo;
       began Miss Hui Fei.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! I wouldn't bother you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! Please&mdash;I don' min'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned; and the boy started impulsively toward her. Miss Carmichael
      moved away, over the deck, but heard him saying, in a broken voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll come back? I've got to tell you something!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To which Miss Hui Fei replied, in a voice that was meant to be at once
      pleasant and impersonal: &ldquo;Why&mdash;yes. I think I'll come back. It's so
      close down there.&rdquo; The two young women went below. Quietly Miss Carmichael
      waited in the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The needle and thread were shortly forthcoming. The white girl smiled;
      seeming really friendly there in the dim ray of light that slanted in
      through a window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's good of you,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;it's nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're in for a rather uncomfortable trip of it. I hope you'll let me do
      anything I can to help you. I'm more used to knocking about, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll all make the best of it,&rdquo; said the Manchu girl, and turned, with an
      effort at a smile, toward the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Carmichael entered her own room. The lantern still burned, but the
      candle-end was low. She saw now an iron lamp, an open dish full of oil
      with a floating wick. This she lighted with the candle. Next, moving about
      almost without a sound, she fastened the swaying door-curtain with pins.
      Then she slipped out of her blouse and skirt; untied the pearl cape; and
      seated on the bed of matting, with her back to the door, began patiently
      sewing the pearls into her undergarments. It was to be a long task. Before
      dawn the lamp burned out, and fearful of being caught asleep with the
      amazing treasure about her she stood at the window and let the wind blow
      into her face until the faintly spreading light of dawn made the work
      again possible. The drowsiness that nearly overcame her now she fought off
      with an iron will. Nothing mattered&mdash;nothing but success. Her thin
      deft fingers worked in a tireless rhythm. Only once, very briefly, did she
      yield to the impulse to weigh the exquisite lustrous globes in her hands;
      to hold them close to the light. Her tireless reason told her that this
      wouldn't do. It brought an excited throbbing to her weary head.... She
      settled again to her task; time enough to gloat later. By way of a healthy
      mental occupation she counted the pearls as she threaded them&mdash;up to
      a thousand&mdash;on up to two thousand&mdash;then (the sun was redly up
      now; and folk were stirring about the deck) three thousand. In all, a few
      more than thirty-seven hundred pearls she threaded about her person; and
      then slipped back into blouse and skirt before permitting herself a few
      hours of sleep. The diamond-studded clasps she wrapped in a bit of cloth
      and stuffed into her hand-bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chinese maid woke her then, bringing food that had been cooked, she
      knew, in the brick stove up forward, where the crew slept. She could bring
      herself to eat but a few mouthfuls.... This didn't matter, either. No
      hardship was of consequence in such a battle as hers; she would have
      submitted coolly to torture rather than surrender her prize. But it
      suggested fresh tactics. She had a knack at cooking. Quietly, later in the
      day&mdash;she knew better than to try effusive friendliness; to play
      herself to the last would be best&mdash;she spoke to Mr. Doane of that
      small gift. A kitchen was improvised in the <i>laopan's</i> cramped
      quarters, aft; and Miss Carmichael, quite intent about her business,
      coolly cheerful about it, indeed, began to prove her capacity. And she
      knew, then, that she was winning. They would soon be respecting her, even
      liking her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even so she would keep her distance; then they would have to keep theirs.
      That was all she needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Rocky, the most elusive memory of all this eventful night was the
      conversation with Miss Hui Fei. For she returned in a moment&mdash;so he
      remembered it&mdash;and sank wearily into the steamer chair. The picture
      of that scene was to vary bafflingly in his mind. At times he saw himself,
      torn with an emotion now so great that it seemed the end of life, standing
      over her, saying, passionately:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know how it looked&mdash;you're finding us here like that! And you'd
      have reason. I did flirt with her. I'm ashamed now. I hadn't seen you&mdash;felt
      you&mdash;like this. But that's all over. I was telling her&mdash;Please!
      You've got to know!&mdash;that I love you. Or telling her enough. She
      understood. And she was awfully decent. She took my hand, wished me luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There must have been a brief time then when the poor girl was endeavoring
      pleasantly to turn aside this torrent of heavily freighted words.
      Certainly he was talking feverishly on. He could remember pulling down a
      coil of rope from the steersman's deck and sitting moodily beside her; and
      there was a sensation in their minds, his and hers, of being at
      cross-purposes. There was something about her, back of the weary smile&mdash;a
      smile that was long to haunt him, dim in the moonlight, exquisite in its
      sensitive beauty&mdash;that eluded his pressing desire until it seemed
      near to driving him mad. Kipling's <i>East is East, and West is West</i>,
      slipped in among his thoughts; kept coming and coming until it became a
      nerve-wracking singsong in his brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one period, fortunately very short, when he seemed to be almost
      forcing a quarrel. Why, he couldn't afterward imagine. That part of it was
      dreadful in the retrospect. He had reached the point, apparently, when he
      couldn't longer endure the failure to reach her. There was simply no
      response. It was almost as if he were frightening her away. Perhaps it was
      just that.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the most vivid memory was of the unaccountable force that suddenly
      rose in him, seizing on his tongue, his brain, his very nerves. The power
      of the Kanes was abruptly his, and it brought its own skill with it. It
      was, distinctly, a possession. It simply came, at this very top of his
      emotional pitch. There must have been preliminaries. He must have said
      things that she must have answered. But these lesser moments dropped out.
      Even a day later, he could see, could almost feel, himself on one knee
      beside the steamer chair, saying those amazing things, without a shred of
      memory as to how he got there. Never had he so spoken, to girl or woman;
      for in the escapades of the younger Rocky there had always been a
      reticence if seldom a restraint. It was precocity; the blood that was in
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You beautiful, wonderful girl!&rdquo; he was breathing, close to her ear. (He
      was never to forget this.) &ldquo;How can you hide your feelings from me? Can't
      you see it's just driving me mad?.... You're adorable! You're exquisite!
      You thrill me so&mdash;just your voice; the way you walk&mdash;your hands&mdash;your
      hair!.... Can't you understand, dear, it isn't what they call 'love.'&rdquo;
       (This with a divine contempt.) &ldquo;It's the cry of my whole being. I want to
      give you my life. I want to know <i>your</i> life&mdash;study it&mdash;come
      to understand the wonderful people that has made you possible! I'm going
      to study it&mdash;history, art, everything!.... I worship you! I dream so
      of you&mdash;all the time&mdash;daytimes! I just half-close my eyes and
      then, right away, I can see you, walking. And I see you as you were at the
      dance on the boat.&rdquo; He choked a little; then rushed on. &ldquo;And in those
      dreams I always take you in my arms&mdash;No, let me say it! The angels
      are singing it, the wonderful truth!&mdash;I take you in my arms and kiss
      your hair and your eyes. You always close your eyes&mdash;oh, so slowly&mdash;and
      I press my lips on the lids. And your arms are around my neck. I can feel
      your hands. But I never kiss your lips&mdash;not in those dreams. Because
      that will mean that you have given me your soul, and I always know I must
      wait for that....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please! You must listen! Can't you see I'm just tearing my heart out and
      putting it in your hands&mdash;under your feet? There isn't any other life
      for me. I can't live without you. I could give up my friends, my home, my
      country, and be happy just serving you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had captured her hand; had it tight in his two hands and was kissing it
      tenderly. The thrill was unbelievable now. It was ecstasy. He could hear
      himself murmuring over and over, &ldquo;You're so exquisite! So thrilling! I
      love the way your hair lies over your forehead. I love your eyes,
      especially when you smile&rdquo;.... On and on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tired sad girl in the steamer chair could not fail to respond in some
      measure, in every sensitive nerve, to so ardent a wooing. Even when she
      rose, and struggled a little to withdraw her hand, she couldn't be angry.
      He was surprising; in his very boyishness, compelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, a little later, he was sitting moodily on the extension front of the
      chair, face in hands, plunged into a wordless abyss; she sat on the edge
      of the steersman's deck, leaning against the rail, her face close to a
      lotus plant, with one flower that looked a ghostly blue in the fading
      moonlight, and just later, shaded through pink to deep red with the first
      quick-spreading color of the dawn. His emotional outburst had passed, for
      the moment, like a gust. He seemed to himself, already, to have failed.
      His thoughts were turned, behind the gray half-covered face, on death. For
      so swung the pendulum. He couldn't, in these depths, draw significance
      from the remarkable fact that she had risen only to drop down again and
      carry forward the talk that he let fall, and that he had, for the time at
      least, swept away those mental obstacles. Certainly Miss Hui Fei was not
      elusive now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The things she was saying, in a deliberate, matter-of-fact way, bewildered
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don' want you to make love to me like tha'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can I help it? You're so wonderful. You thrill me so. I tell you
      it's my whole life. I can never live on without you&mdash;not any more.
      It's got to be with you, or&mdash;or nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was strange. This impulsive affection had grown very, very rapidly
      within him; yet, even a day earlier he couldn't have pictured this scene.
      Not a phrase of these burning sentences he was so fervently uttering had
      been consciously framed in his mind. A part of the thrill of the situation
      lay in the very fact that he was so wildly committing himself. Now that it
      was being said, he felt no desire to take a word back. He meant it all;
      and more&mdash;more.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she&mdash;still, even in the telltale morning light, quaint, charming,
      adorable&mdash;was growing so practical about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a ver' romantic boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not! This is real! Can't you understand that it's love&mdash;forever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please!.... I don' want you to think I don' un'erstan'. It's ver' sweet
      an' generous of you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not generous! I want you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do apprecia' all it woul' mean. You offer me so much&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dear girl, I offer you everything&mdash;everything I have or am! I
      don't want to live at all unless it's with you always at my side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't think&mdash;Please! I woui'n' hurt you for anything. You've
      helped so&mdash;helped saving my father's life an' mine. It's won'erful&mdash;but
      I don' think life is like that. People mus' have so much in common to
      marry in the Western way. They mus' love each other, yes. But in their
      min's an' feelings they mus' share so much&mdash;their backgroun's....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was out of the chair now; was beside her on the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; he was huskily saying. &ldquo;We'll get married right away in Shanghai.
      We've got to! I won't let you say no! And then we won't go back. Well stay
      out here. There'll be money enough, in spite of the pater. We'll study
      this East together. I'm going to devote all the rest of my life to it.
      We'll build our common interest. I shall never want anything else!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you knew that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you doubt me?&rdquo; He had both her hands now. He seemed so young, so
      eager. He would fight for what he greatly desired, as his father had
      fought before him. However crudely, boyishly, he would fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&rdquo;&mdash;her own voice was, surprisingly, a little unsteady&mdash;&ldquo;of
      course I don' doubt you. But how can you know what you're going to wan'&mdash;years
      from now. I don' un'erstan' that. It does seem pretty romantic to me. I
      don't know for myself. I coul'n' tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, or perhaps it was her failure to rise to his ecstasy, plunged him
      again into the depths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's you or nothing now,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;You or nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wha' do you mean by that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got to have you. If I can't, I'll&mdash;oh, I guess I'll just drop
      quietly overboard. What's the use?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it's fair to talk li' that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not, but&mdash;I guess I'm beside myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said she now: with a friendly, even sympathetic pressure of his
      trembling hands, &ldquo;I'll tell you what I think. I think the thing for you to
      do is to go back to college.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This stung him. &ldquo;How can you talk like that,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;when&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don' wan' to hurt you. But please try to think this as I wan' you to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't you <i>any</i> feeling for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, an' I'm ver' grateful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's sake, don't talk like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. He withdrew his hands; plunged his feverish face into
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose, wearily. Said: &ldquo;I'm going to try to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you could go? Leaving it like this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please! I can't help&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I understand&mdash;&rdquo; he was on his feet before her; caught her arms
      in his hands that now were firm and young&mdash;&ldquo;I haven't moved you yet,
      that's all. But I will. We Kanes aren't quitters. We don't give up. And
      I'm not going to give you up. I'm going to win you. Can't you see that
      I've got to? That I can't live.... Listen! You're the loveliest, daintiest
      little girl in the world. You're exquisite. Your voice is music to me.
      I've got to live my life to that music. It'll be beautiful! Can't you see
      that? I don't care how much time it takes. I'll settle down to it. But
      I'll win you. And we'll be married at Shanghai?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was very nearly irresistible now. The power in him was real. She broke
      away; then, a surprise to herself, lingered. Strangely to her, this
      ardent, still somewhat impossible boy, with his vital, Western force, had
      actually created an atmosphere of romance in which she was, for the
      moment, and in a degree, enveloped. She knew, clearly enough, that she
      must exert herself to escape from it: but lingered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught her hands again; covered them with kisses; held them firmly
      while his eyes, suddenly radiant, sought hers and, during a moving
      instant, held them. She went below then. And Rocky dropped into the
      steamer chair and smiled exultantly as he drifted into slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they met again, away from the others, after an excellent luncheon of
      fowl and vegetables prepared by the surprising Miss Carmichael, his mood
      was wholly changed. He had charm; consciously or unconsciously, he made it
      felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn't fair to you,&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don' min',&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;we jus' won' talk abou' that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't help it.&rdquo; He smiled a little. &ldquo;There's no use pretending I can
      think about another thing. I'm madly in love with you&mdash;hopelessly
      gone. It'll probably simplify things if you'll just accept that as a fact.
      But last night&mdash;this morning&mdash;whenever it was!&mdash;after all
      we'd been through&mdash;you know, it wasn't so unnatural that I got all
      fired up that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As this half-smiling, half-serious youth was plainly going to be even more
      difficult to manage than the ardent boy of the glowing dawn, she was
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's the thing,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I was too worn out myself to be
      considerate of you. I meant every word, of course. You'll never know how
      wonderful you seem to me.&rdquo; This rather wistfully. They were leaning on the
      rail, gazing at the rocky hills along the southern bank. &ldquo;It's all wrong
      for me to be so impatient. I know I've got to make good. I've got to earn
      you. That won't come all at once. But I am going to try not to get stirred
      up like that again. God knows you've got enough to bother you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm ver' uncertain abou' my father,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;he stays in his room. He doesn' come out with us. An' he's
      always working.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;does that mean anything? Wouldn't he naturally be busy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don' think so. No, like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't understand what&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn' easy to say. When a man like father&mdash;what you call a
      mandarin&mdash;feels that he mus'&rdquo;&mdash;her voice wavered&mdash;&ldquo;that he
      mus' go, there is a grea' deal that he must wri' to his frien's an' to the
      governmen'. He doesn' wan' to be disturb'. I can' tell wha' he's doing. It
      worries me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane, during the sunny dreamy afternoon, heard them, now and again. They
      were quite monopolizing the pleasant after gallery. And they were drifting
      on into their love story. He could not restrain himself from watching and
      listening. Despite the fact that his own dream was over, Doane felt about
      it, in his heart, like a boy. The sight of her quickened his pulse.
      Thoughts of her&mdash;mental pictures&mdash;came irresistibly. And these,
      at times, puzzled his heart if never his reason; the moment on the top
      deck of the steamer, when she climbed the after ladder and first confided
      her tragic difficulty; the dance she &ldquo;sat out&rdquo; with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      .... He called himself, often enough, a fool. But his spirit refused to
      accept the words that formed in his mind. He was simply at war with
      himself.... The sort of thing happened often enough in life, of course.
      Every man lived through such periods. Men of middle age in particular....
      Thus he fell back, over and again, on reason. It was all he could do.
      Plainly the experience would take a lot of living through.
    </p>
    <p>
      To hope that her quick youth could altogether resist Rocky's ardent youth
      was asking too much, of course. The young people were almost certain to
      find themselves helpless&mdash;their emotions stirred by what they had
      been living through; thrown together here, romantically, on the junk.
      Whatever small difficulties they might encounter in exploring each other's
      nascent feelings would be softened by the very air they were breathing.
      The young are often, usually, helpless when nature so works upon them....
      But Doane wasn't bitter. At times he nearly convinced himself that he felt
      only concern lest they rush along too fast; surrender their hearts, only
      to find too late that the necessary affinity was not growing into flower.
      The boy must have some proving, of course. That lovely girl mustn't be
      sacrificed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in the afternoon they were singing, softly, even humorously. Doane
      caught snatches of <i>Mandalay</i>, and the college songs. That would seem
      to them a fine bond, of course&mdash;the mere casual fact that both knew
      the songs. For youth is quite as simple as that.... So they were rushing
      on with it, while an older man pondered. Rocky hung unashamed on her every
      word, every movement; waited forlornly about whenever she went below;
      starting at sounds, sinking into moods, and shining with radiance when she
      reappeared. He even had gentle moments.... What girl could be insensible
      to all that? He himself was avoiding them, of course. There was no helping
      that; certainly in this stage of the romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      His excellency appeared on deck during the second afternoon; greeted Doane
      in friendly fashion&mdash;looking oddly simple in his servant costume;
      blue gown, plain cloth slippers, skull-cap with a knot of vermilion silk.
      They walked the deck together; later, they sat on a coil of rope. In
      manner he was very nearly his old self; smiling a thought less, perhaps,
      but as humanly direct in his talk as a Chinese.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall soon be parting, Grigsby Doane,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;and I shall think
      much of you. Do you know yet where you shall go and what you shall do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Doane replied. &ldquo;All I can do now is the next thing, whatever that
      may prove to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will help China?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall hope for an opportunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are, first and last, a Westerner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did think you a philosopher, Griggsby Doane. So you seemed to me. Like
      our humble great, almost like Chuang Tzü himself. But in the moment of
      crisis your nature found expression wholly in action. At such times we of
      the East are likely to be negative. We are a static people. But you, like
      your own, are dynamic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This shrewd bit of observation struck Doane sharply. Come to think, it was
      true.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the critical moment you wasted not one thought in reflection. You
      weighed none of the difficulties; you ignored consequences. You took
      command. You acted. As a result&mdash;here we are.... I suppose you were
      right. At any rate, I yielded to your active judgment. It has saved my
      daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, as well, Your Excellency, if I may say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well&mdash;myself too.... I shall always think of you now as I have
      twice seen you&mdash;once in that curious boxing match on the steamer; and
      again as you took command of me and my own house. I regret that in my
      position as a Manchu, however progressive, I can not be of any
      considerable service to you with the republicans. It is in their camp that
      your advice will help. Only there. Shall you go to them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane found it impossible to mention the invitation of Sun-Shi-pi. That
      would be a sacred confidence. So he replied in merely general terms:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to sit in their councils. They seem to represent, at this
      time, China's only material hope. Though I am not strongly an optimist
      regarding the revolution. China is so vast, so sunken in tradition, that
      the real revolution must be distressingly slow. Still, I have some
      familiarity with the constitutional history of my own country, and, I
      think, some acquaintance with yours. And I love China. Yes, I should like
      to help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a great man, Griggsby Doane. You have known sorrow and poverty.
      To the merely successful American I do not look for much real guidance.
      But China needs you. I hope she will find you out in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They talked on, of many things. His excellency was gently, at times even
      whimsically, reflective. At length he touched, lightly at first, on the
      subject of Rocky Kane. A little later, more openly, he asked what the
      boy's standing would be in New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane thought this over very carefully. It was curious how that confusing
      element of mere feeling reappeared promptly in his mind. But he explained,
      finally, that while the boy was young, and had been passing through a
      phase of rather adventurous wildness, still his father was a man of
      enormous prestige in society as in the financial world. The boy had nice
      qualities. Given the right influences he might, with the wealth that would
      one day be his, become like his father, a powerful factor in American
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find myself somewhat puzzled,&rdquo; remarked his excellency then. &ldquo;He seems
      devoted to my daughter. I can not easily read her mind. And I would not
      attempt to direct her life as would be necessary had she been merely a
      Manchu girl reared in a Manchu environment. Is she, do you think, and as
      your people understand the term, in love with him? I find their present
      relationship somewhat alarming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be difficult to say, Your Excellency&mdash;&rdquo; thus Doane, simply
      and gravely. &ldquo;The young man is, of course, in love with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; breathed his excellency. &ldquo;You are sure of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She is undoubtedly accustomed to play about pleasantly with young
      men as do the young women of America.&rdquo; Sudden, poignant memories came of
      his own lovely daughter, as she had been; and of the puzzling romance that
      had seemed for a time to injure her young life&mdash;a romance in which
      he, her father, had played a strange part. But that was, after all, but an
      echo from another life; a closed book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your daughter, I am sure,&rdquo; Doane continued, &ldquo;can be trusted to form her
      own attachments. She is a noble as well as a beautiful girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed&mdash;you find her so, Griggsby Doane? That is pleasant to my
      ears. For into the directing of her life have gone my dreams of the new
      China and the new world. I would not have her choose wrongly now. But I do
      not understand her. It is difficult for me to talk freely with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; said Doane slowly, &ldquo;that if you could bring yourself to do
      so&rdquo;&mdash;as once or twice before, in moments of deep feeling, he forgot
      to use the indirect Oriental form of address&mdash;&ldquo;it would make her very
      happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think that, Griggsby Doane?&rdquo; His excellency considered this. Then
      added: &ldquo;I will make the effort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I may suggest&mdash;talk with her not as father with daughter, but on
      an equality, as friend with friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His excellency slowly rose; and Doane, also rising, felt for the first
      time that the fine old statesman fully looked his age. He was, standing
      there, smiling a thought wistfully, an old man, little short of a broken
      man. And then his dry thin hand found Doane's huge one and gripped it in
      the Western manner. This was a surprise, evidently as moving to Kang as to
      Doane himself; for they stood thus a moment in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dearest hope, of late,&rdquo; said the great Manchu&mdash;the smoothest of
      etiquette giving way, for once, before the pressure of emotion&mdash;&ldquo;has
      been that my daughter's heart might be entrusted to you, Griggsby Doane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again a silence. Then Doane:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was my hope, as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It is plainly impossible. All life is before her. The thought has not
      come to her. It never will. I see now that she could not be happy with me.
      And I think she ought to be happy. I must ask you not to speak of this
      again. Let youth call unto youth. And let me be her friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His excellency went below after this. Miss Hui Fei was also below,
      sleeping. Rocky Kane had been playing with the little princess, out on the
      gallery; but now, evidently watching his chance, he came forward to the
      informal seat the mandarin had vacated.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to be difficult&mdash;always difficult. The boy, plainly, couldn't
      live through these tense days without a confidant. Doane steeled himself
      to bear it, and to respond as a friend. There was no way out; would be
      none short of Shanghai; just an exquisite torture. It was even to grow,
      with each fresh contact, harder to bear. The boy was so curiously
      unsophisticated, so earnest and honest an egotist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;I've asked her,&rdquo; he said now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane could only wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She hasn't said yes. That would be absurd, of course&mdash;so soon.&rdquo; He
      was so pitifully putting up a brave front. &ldquo;But she does like me. And it's
      something that she hasn't said no. Isn't it something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was hardly a question; it was nearer assertion&mdash;what he had to
      think. Doane managed to incline his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But never mind that. God knows why I should bother you with it. You've
      been so kind&mdash;such a friend. We&mdash;are friends, aren't we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane felt himself obliged to turn and meet his eyes. And such eyes!
      Ablaze with nervous light. And then he had to grip another hand&mdash;this
      one young, moist, strong. But he managed that, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen! I do bother you awfully, but&mdash;I've been thinking&mdash;here
      we are, you know. God knows when I'll find a man who could help me as you
      can. And we brought all those wonderful old paintings aboard here. I've
      been thinking&mdash;well, since I've got so much to learn of Chinese
      culture, why not begin? Couldn't I&mdash;would they mind if I looked at
      some of the pictures? And&mdash;if it isn't asking too much&mdash;you
      could tell me why they're good. Just begin to give me something to go by.
      Isn't it as good a way to make the break as any?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a most acceptable diversion. Doane, though several boxes of the
      paintings were in his own rooms, sent a servant to ask a permission that
      was cordially granted. And as there was a wind blowing, they went below,
      and talked there in low voices in order not to disturb the sleeping girl,
      while the elder man carefully opened a box and got out a number of the
      long scrolls that were wound on rods of ivory, handling them with reverent
      fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He chose one from the brush of that Chao Meng-fu who flourished under the
      earliest Mongol or Yuan rulers, a roll perhaps fourteen or fifteen inches
      in width, and in length, judging from the thickness, as many feet, tied
      around with silk cords and fastened with tags of carven jade. The painting
      itself, naturally, was on silk, which in turn was pasted on thick,
      dark-toned paper, made of bamboo pulp, with borders of brocade. The
      projecting ends of the ivory rollers, like the tags, were carved.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the edge of the scroll were, besides the seal signature of the artist,
      and the date&mdash;in our chronology, A. D. 1308&mdash;many other
      signatures in the conventional square seal characters of royal and other
      collectors who had possessed the painting, with also, a few pithy,
      appreciative epigrams from eminent critics of various periods. On that one
      margin was stamped the authentic history of the particular bit of silk,
      paper and pigment during its life of six full centuries; for no hand could
      have forged those seals.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no likelihood that the boy&mdash;lacking, as he was, in cultural
      background&mdash;would exhibit any sensitive responsiveness to the
      exquisite brush-work of the fine old painter or to his consciously
      subjective attitude toward his art. But there is a way in which the simple
      Western mind that is not preoccupied with fixed concepts of art may be led
      into enjoyment of such a landscape scroll; this is to exhibit it as do the
      Chinese themselves, unrolling it, very slowly, a little at a time,
      deliberately absorbing the detail and the finely suggested atmosphere,
      until a sensation is experienced not unlike that of making a journey
      through a strange and delightful country. Doane employed this method&mdash;it
      was surely what that old painter intended&mdash;and led the boy slowly
      from a pastoral home, so small beneath its towering overhanging mountain
      crags, that lost themselves finally in soft cloud-masses, as to appear
      insignificant, out along a river where lines of reeds swayed in the winds
      and boats moved patiently, across a lake that was dotted with pavilions
      and pleasure craft&mdash;on and on, through varied scenes that yet were
      blended with amazing craftsmanship into a continuous, harmonious whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time crept by and by. When Doane finally explained the seal characters
      at the end and retied the old silk cords with their hanging rectangles of
      unclouded green jade, the sun was low over the western hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rocky's face was flushed, his eyes nervously bright. &ldquo;I don't get it all,
      of course,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but it makes you feel somehow as if you'd been
      reading <i>The Pilgrim's Progress!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane gravely nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we look at another?&rdquo; said Rocky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. That is enough. The Chinese knew better than to crowd the mind with
      confused impressions of many paintings. A good picture is an experience to
      be lived through, not a trophy to be glanced at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;if that's why I used to hate it so when my
      tutor dragged me through the Metropolitan Museum?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this picture has a great value, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is virtually priceless&mdash;in East as well as West,&rdquo; replied Doane
      as he replaced it among its fellows in the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus began, late but perhaps not too late, what may be regarded as the
      education of young Rockingham Kane.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII&mdash;AT THE HOUR OF THE TIGER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HEY passed, that
      evening, the region of Peng-tze where Tao Yuan-ming, after a scant three
      months as district magistrate, surrendered his honors and retired to his
      humble farm near Kiu Kiang, there to write in peace the verse and prose
      that have endured during sixteen crowded centuries; and on, then, moving
      slowly through the precipitous Gateway of Anking and, later, around the
      bend that bounds that city on the west, south and east. Those on deck
      could see, indistinctly in the deepening twilight, the vast area of houses
      and ruins&mdash;for Anking had not yet recovered from the devastations of
      the T'ai-ping rebels in the eighteen-sixties&mdash;where half a million
      yellow folk swarm like ants; and very indistinctly indeed, farther to the
      north, they could see: the blue mountains. Slowly, quietly, then, Anking,
      with its ruins and its memories fell away astern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later the sweeps were lashed along the rail. The great dark
      sails, with their scalloped edges between the battens of bamboo, seeming
      more than ever, in the dusk, like the wings of an enormous bat, were
      lowered; and with many shouts and rhythmic cries the tracking ropes were
      run out to mooring poles on the bank. Forward the mattings were adjusted
      for the night. The smells of tobacco and frying fish drifted aft. A youth,
      sipping tea by the rail, put down his cup and sang softly in falsetto a
      long narrative of friendship and the mighty river and (incidentally) the
      love of a maiden who slipped away from her mother's side at night to meet
      a handsome student only to be slain, as was just, by the hand of an elder
      brother.... From the cabin aft drifted a faint odor of incense. A
      flageolet mingled its plaintive oboe-like note with the song of the youth
      by the rail.... From a near-by village came soft evening sounds, and the
      occasional barking of dogs, and the beat of a watchman's gong.... The
      greatest of rivers&mdash;greatest in traffic and in rich memories of the
      endless human drama&mdash;was settling quietly for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first rays of dawn the forward deck would be again astir. Sails
      would be hoisted, ropes hauled aboard and coiled; and the shining yellow
      craft would resume her journey down-stream, with carven and brightly
      painted eyes peering fixedly out at the bow, with carefully tended flowers
      perfuming the air about the after gallery, a thing of rich and lovely
      color even on the rich and lovely river; slipping by busy ports, each with
      its vast tangle of small shipping and its innumerable families of beggars
      in slipper-boats or tubs awaiting miserably the steamers and their
      strangely prodigal white passengers. T'ai-ping itself, of bloody memory,
      lay still ahead; and farther yet Nanking the glorious, and Chin-kiang, and
      the great estuary. Slowly the huge craft would drift and sail and tie,
      moving patiently on toward the Shanghai of the ever-prospering white
      merchants, the Shanghai that somewhat vaingloriously had dubbed itself
      &ldquo;the Paris of the East.&rdquo; And no one of the thousands, here and there, that
      idly watched the golden junk as it moved, not without a degree of
      magnificence, down the tireless current, was to know that a Manchu
      viceroy, a prince hunted to the death by his own blood, a statesman known
      to the courts of great new lands, was in hiding within those timbers of
      polished cypress. Nor would they know that a princess, his daughter yet
      strangely of the new order, voyaged with him clad in the simple costume of
      a young Chinese woman. Nor would they dream of certain inexplicable
      whites. Nor would they have cared; for the voyage of the yellow junk was
      but a tiny incident in the crowded endless drama of the river; to the
      millions of struggling, breeding, dying souls along the banks and on the
      water, merely living was and would be burden enough. So China merely lives&mdash;dreaming
      a little but hoping hardly at all&mdash;with every eye on the furrow or
      the till; lives, and dies, and&mdash;lives again and on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in the third afternoon, Rocky Kane, sitting, head forlornly in hands,
      in his narrow room, heard a light step&mdash;heard it with every sensitive
      nerve-tip&mdash;and, springing up, softly drew his curtain. But the quick
      eagerness faded from his eyes; for it was Dixie Carmichael.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her thin lips curved in the faintest of smiles as she moved along the
      corridor toward her own curtained door. But then, as she passed and
      glanced back, her skirt, in swinging about, caught on a nail; caught
      firmly; and as she stooped to release it, a string of pearls swung down,
      broke, and rolled, a score of little opalescent spheres, along the deck, a
      few of them nearly to Rocky's feet. He stooped&mdash;without a thought at
      first&mdash;picked them up and turned them over in his fingers; then,
      stepping forward to return them, observed with an odd thrill of somewhat
      unpleasant excitement, that the girl had gone an ashen color and was
      staring at him with something the look of a wild and hostile animal. She
      turned then; glanced with furtive eyes up and down the corridor; and
      swiftly gathering up the remaining pearls clutched them tightly in one
      hand, extending the other and saying, in a quick half-whisper: &ldquo;Give me
      those.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated, confused, unequal to the quick clear thinking he felt, even
      then, was demanded of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing with them?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so loud! Come here!&rdquo; She was indicating her own doorway; even drawing
      the curtain; while her head moved just perceptibly toward the room
      immediately beyond her own where Miss Hui Fei, he knew, would be resting
      at this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you get them?&rdquo; he asked, huskily, doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long pause. Again her subtle gaze swept the corridor. &ldquo;You'd
      better step in here,&rdquo; said she, very quiet. &ldquo;I've something to say to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sensing, still confusedly, that he ought to see the thing through,
      struggling to think, he yielded to her stronger will.
    </p>
    <p>
      She followed him into the room and let the curtain fall. &ldquo;Give me those
      pearls,&rdquo; she commanded again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      During a tense moment she studied him. She moved over by the translucent
      window of ground oyster shells, itself, in the mellow afternoon light, as
      opalescent as the pearls in her hand and his. Her gaze, for an instant,
      sought the wide stain on the floor where the Manila Kid had, so recently,
      wretchedly died; and her instant imagination considered the
      incomprehensible mental attitude of these quiet Chinese who had, without a
      word, disposed of the body and painstakingly cleansed the spot. No one,
      observing them day by day, now, as they calmly pursued their tasks, could
      suspect that the slanting quiet eyes had so lately seen murder.... As for
      the youth before her she was, now that her moment of fright had passed,
      supremely confident in her skill and mental strength. He was, still,
      little more than an undeveloped boy. And his position, now that he had set
      up his flag of reform, would be absurdly vulnerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once more&rdquo;&mdash;her low voice was cool and soft as river ice&mdash;&ldquo;give
      them to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;Tell me first where you got them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you're determined to make a scene,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I advise you to be
      quiet about it. You wouldn't want&mdash;her&mdash;to know you're in here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rdquo;&mdash;this was the merest boyishness&mdash;&ldquo;I've told her
      about&mdash;well, that I tried to make love to you. I'm not afraid of
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still&mdash;you wouldn't want her to hear you now.&rdquo; This was awkwardly
      true. And his hesitation as he tried to consider it, to work out an
      attitude, ran a second too long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pearls are mine,&rdquo; she pressed calmly on. &ldquo;The best advice I can give
      you is to return them and go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I want the people aboard this junk&mdash;anybody&mdash;to
      know that I have them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you stole them from the viceroy's place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, of course&mdash;Well, never mind! What you may believe is nothing
      to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you tell Mr. Doane about them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. And you won't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn't I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's none of your business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it's my duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen&rdquo;&mdash;he felt himself wholly in the right, yet found difficulty
      in meeting her cold pale eyes&mdash;&ldquo;it's my impression that I've been
      acting rather decently toward you. Of course, I could have&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What could you have done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For you own good, keep your voice down. I will tell you just this&mdash;you
      were pretty wild in Shanghai for a week or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; This was hurting him; but he met it. &ldquo;And there's no likelihood
      that you've told her all of it. Were you such a fool as to think you could
      keep it all secret? Out here on the coast&mdash;and from a woman with as
      many underground connections as I have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothing that!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen! I'm not through with you. You've been a very, very rough
      proposition. I know all about it. No&mdash;wait! There's something else. I
      knew all about you when you were making up to me on the steamer. I could
      have trapped you then&mdash;tangled your life so with mine that you could
      never have got away from me, never in the world. But I didn't. I liked
      you, and I didn't want to hurt you&mdash;then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do want to hurt me now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you're taking this position&rdquo;&mdash;he was finding difficulty in
      making his voice heard; there seemed to be danger of explosive sounds&mdash;&ldquo;probably
      I'd better just go to Mr. Doane myself with these things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do that I'll wreck your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean that you'd&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to be forgetting a good deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will defend myself to the limit. I've really been easy with you. You
      see, you don't know anything about me. Least of all what harm I can do.
      You'd be a child in my hands. Turn against me and I'll get you if it takes
      me ten years. You'll never be safe from me. Never for a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked irresolutely down at the lustrous jewels in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had these sewed in your skirt. There must be more there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you proposing to search me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;but&rdquo;.... His black youth was stabbing now, viciously, at his
      boyishly sensitive heart; but still, in a degree, he met it. &ldquo;I'm going to
      Mr. Doane. I don't care what happens to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He even moved a soft step toward the door; but paused, lingered, watching
      her. For she was rummaging among the covers of her bed. He caught a brief
      glimpse of a hand-bag that she meant him not to see. She took from a
      bottle two green tablets. Then she faced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the startled question of his eyes she replied: &ldquo;They're corrosive sub
      mate. I shall take them now unless you&mdash;give me the pearls. If you
      want to have my death on your hands, take them to Mr. Doane. But it's only
      fair to tell you that if you do it&mdash;if you mix in this business&mdash;your
      own life won't be worth a nickel. They'll get you, and they'll get the
      pearls. You're caught in a bigger game than you can play.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out, while you can&rdquo;&mdash;as the low swift words came she reached out
      and took the pearls from his nerveless hand&mdash;&ldquo;and I'll protect you.
      You can have your pretty Manchu girl. You can ride around in a rickshaw
      and look at old temples and buy embroideries. Just don't mix in affairs
      that don't concern you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rdquo;&mdash;he was pressing a hand to a white forehead&mdash;&ldquo;I've got to
      think it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember this, too&rdquo;&mdash;she laid a hand on his arm&mdash;&ldquo;you could
      never fasten anything on me. The proof doesn't exist. Nobody can identify
      unmounted pearls. As a matter of fact I got these&rdquo;... during a brief but
      to her perverse imagination an intensely pleasing moment she closed her
      eyes and lived again through that strange scene on the steps of the
      pavilion; again in vivid fancy rolled over the inert body that had been
      Tex Connor, took the amazing cape of pearls from his shirt and rolled the
      body heavily back...."I got these from a man I knew&mdash;an old friend.
      Just mind your own business and no one will harm you. But remember, you're
      walking among dangers. Step carefully. Keep quiet. Better go now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He found himself in the corridor; walked slowly, uncertainly, up to the
      deck; sat by the rail and, head on hand, moodily watched the river and the
      hills. He asked himself if he had, by his very silence, struck a bargain
      with the girl; but could find no answer to the question, only
      bewilderment. Could it be that she was only a daring thief? It could, of
      course, but how to get at the truth? Abruptly, then his thoughts turned
      inward. His wild days had seemed, since his change of heart, of the remote
      past; but they were not, they had still been the stuff of his life within
      about a week. It was unnerving. He thought, something morbidly, as the
      sensitive young will, about habits.... The day had gone awry, too, in the
      matter of his love. A reaction had set in. Hui Fei was keeping much to
      herself. It had become difficult to talk with her at all. And that had
      bewildered him.... He was all adrift, with neither sound training nor a
      mature philosophy to steady him, life had turned unreal on his hands;
      nothing was real&mdash;not Hui or her father, certainly not himself, not
      even Mr. Doane. His background, even, was slipping away, and with it his
      sense of the white race. This, it seemed, was a yellow world&mdash;swarming,
      heedless, queerly tragic. His soul was adrift, and nobody cared. Toward
      his father and mother he felt only bitterness. There were, it appeared, no
      friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought, it seemed, confusedly, excitedly, of everything; of everything
      except the important fact that he was very young.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early on the following morning Doane found the little princess playing
      about the deck, and with a smile seated himself beside her. She settled at
      once on his knee, chattering brightly in the Mandarin tongue of her play
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      He responded with a note of good-humored whimsy not out of key with her
      alert clear imagination. It was pleasant to fall again into the little
      intimacies of the language that had become, during these twenty years and
      more, almost his own. He pointed out to her the trained cormorants diving
      for fish, and the irrigating wheels along the banks; and then told quaint
      stories&mdash;of the first water buffalo, and of the magic rice-field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon she, too, was telling stories&mdash;of the simpleton who bought
      herons for ducks, of the toad in the lotus pool, of the child that was
      born in a conch shell and finally crawled with it into the sea, of the
      youngest daughter who to save the life of her father married a snake, of
      the magic melon that grew full of gold and the other melon that contained
      hungry beggars, of the two small boys and the moon cake, and of the
      curious beginning of the ant species.
    </p>
    <p>
      She scolded him for his failure, at the first, to laugh with her. Her
      happy child quality stirred memories of old-time days in T'ainan-fu, when
      his own daughter had been a child of six, playing happily about the
      mission compound. They were poignant memories. His eyes were misty even as
      he smiled over the bright merriment of this child, and in his heart was a
      growing wistful tenderness. To be again a father would be a great
      privilege. He was ripe for it now, tempered by poverty and sorrow, yet
      strong, with a great emotional capacity on which the world about him had,
      apparently, no claim to make. He was simply cast aside, left carelessly in
      an eddy with the great stream of life flowing, bankful, by. The experience
      was common enough, of course. In the great scheme of life the fate of an
      individual here and there could hardly matter. He could tell himself that,
      very simply, quite honestly; and yet the strength within him would rise
      and rise again to assert the opposite. The end, for himself, lay beyond
      the range of conscious thought; but at least, he felt, it could not be
      bitterness. He seemed to have passed that danger.... The little princess
      was soberly telling the old story of the father-in-law, the father, and
      the crabs that were eaten by the pig. At the conclusion she laughed
      merrily; and then Ending his response somewhat unsatisfactory, scowled
      fiercely and with her plump fingers bent up the corers of his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed then; and rolled her up in his arms and tossed her high in the
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Hui Fei came upon them they were gazing out over the rail. Mr. Doane
      seemed to be telling a long story, to which the child listened intently.
      She moved quietly near, smiling; and after listening for a few moments
      seated herself on the deck behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story puzzled her. She leaned forward, a charming picture in her
      simple costume, black hair parted smoothly, oval face untouched with
      powder or paint. She smiled again, then, for his story was nothing other
      than a free rendering into Chinese of Stevenson's:=
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In Winter I get up at night
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dress by yellow candle-light..."=
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on, when that was finished, with a version of:=
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dark brown is the river,
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden is the sand...."=
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;and other poems from <i>The Child's Garden of Verses.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Hui Fei's eyes lighted, as she listened. Mr. Doane, it appeared, knew
      nearly all of these exquisite verse-stories of happy childhood and
      exhibited surprising skill in finding the Chinese equivalents for certain
      elusive words. What a mind he had.... rich in reading as in experience,
      ripe in wisdom, yet curiously fresh and elastic! It seemed to her a young
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little princess was especially pleased with <i>My Bed Is a Boat</i>,
      and made him repeat it. At the conclusion she clapped her hands. And then
      Hui Fei joined in the applause, and laughed softly when they turned in
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you do <i>The Land of Counterpane?</i>&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was later, when the child had run off to play among the flowers, that
      he and she fell to talking as they had not talked during these recent
      crowded days. There were silences, at first. Despite his effort to seem
      merely friendly and kind, he felt a restraint that had to be fought
      through. In this time, so difficult for her at every point, he felt deeply
      that he must not fail her. Her greatest need, surely, was for friendship.
      The excited youth who dogged her steps and hung on her most trivial glance
      could not offer that. And melancholy had touched her bright spirit; he
      sensitively felt that when the little princess ran away and her smile
      faded. Sorrow dwelt not far behind those dark thoughtful eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the conversation she spoke of her father. Her thoughts, clearly,
      were always with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wan' to ask you,&rdquo; said she simply and gravely, &ldquo;if you know what he is
      doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane moved his head in the negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been in his room for more than a day. When I go to his door he is
      kin' but he doesn' ask me to come in. And he doesn' tell me anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not confiding in me,&rdquo; said Doane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don' like that, either, Mis'er Doane. For I know he thinks of you now
      as his closes' frien'. There is no other frien' who knows what you know.
      An' you have save' his life an' mine. My father is not a man to fail in
      frien'ship or in gratitu'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane's eyes, despite his nearly successful inner struggles, grew misty
      again. Impulsively he took her hand gently in his. At once, simply, her
      slender fingers closed about his own. It seemed not unlike the trusting
      affection of a child; he sensed this as a new pain. Yet there was strong
      emotional quality in her; he felt it in her dark beauty, in the curve of
      her cheek and the lustrous troubled splendor in her eyes, in the slender
      curves of her strong young body. She was, after all, a woman grown;
      aroused, doubtless, to the puzzling facts of life; a woman, with an ardent
      lover close at hand, who was&mdash;this as his wholly adult mind now saw
      her&mdash;already at her mating time. And feeling this he gripped her hand
      more tightly than he knew. But even so, he was not unaware of his own
      danger. It wouldn't do; once to release his own tightly chained emotions
      would be to render himself of no greater value to her in her bewilderment
      than any merely pursuing male. He set his teeth on that thought, and
      abruptly withdrew his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not look up&mdash;her gaze was fixed on the surface of the river.
      The only indication she gave that she was so much as aware of this odd
      little act of his was that she started to speak, then paused for a brief
      instant before going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask&mdash;ask myself all the time if there is anything we coul' be
      doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane's head moved again in the negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If not even his gratitu'&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gratitude,&rdquo; said Doane gently, &ldquo;becomes less than nothing when it is
      demanded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, it can no' be ask', but it can be given.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes&rdquo;&mdash;he was thinking aloud, dangerously&mdash;&ldquo;I wonder if
      any healthy human act is free from the motive of self-interest. Generosity
      is so often self-indulgence. Self-sacrifice, even in cases where it may be
      regarded as wholly sane, may be only a culmination or a confusion of
      little understood desires.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at this; considered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;your father owes me nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hand moved a little way toward his, only to hesitate and draw back.
      She looked away, saying in a clouded voice: &ldquo;He&mdash;and I&mdash;owe you
      everything.&rdquo; It wouldn't do. Doane waited a long moment, then spoke in
      what seemed more nearly his own proper character&mdash;quietly, kindly,
      with hardly an outward sign of the intensely personal feeling of which his
      heart was so full.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father has spoken to me of you as an experiment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean my life&mdash;my education.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He feels, too, that the experiment has not yet been fully worked
      out. I often think of that&mdash;your future. It is interesting, you know.
      You have responded amazingly to the spirit of the West. And of course
      you'll have to do something about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said she, musing, &ldquo;of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever personal interests may for a time&mdash;or at times&mdash;absorb
      your life&rdquo;.... this was as close as he dared trust himself to the topic of
      marriage__"I feel about you that your life will seek and find some strong
      outward expression.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I have often fel' that too. Of course, at college I like' to
      speak. I went in a good 'eal for the debates, an' for class politics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have an active mind. And you have a fine heritage. Knowing&mdash;even
      feeling&mdash;both East and West as you do, your life is bound to find
      some public outlet. Something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know.&rdquo; She seemed moody now, in a gentle way. Her fingers picked at a
      rope. &ldquo;But I don' know what. I don' think I woul' like teaching. Writing,
      perhaps. Even speaking. That is so easy for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a service that you are peculiarly fitted to perform.&rdquo; She
      glanced up quickly, waited. &ldquo;It is a thought that keeps coming to my mind.
      Perhaps because it will probably become the final expression of my own
      life. For my life is curiously like yours in one way. You remember, that&mdash;that
      night when we first talked&mdash;on the steamer&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I climb' the ladder,&rdquo; she murmured, picking again at the rope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;And we agreed that we were both, you and I&rdquo;&mdash;his voice grew
      momentarily unsteady&mdash;&ldquo;between the worlds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I remember.&rdquo; He could barely hear her, &ldquo;It is true, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true. And for myself, I feel more and more strongly every day that
      I must pitch into the tremendous task of helping to make the East known to
      the West.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tha' woul' be won'erful!&rdquo; she breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to feel that it is the one great want in Western
      civilization, that the philosophy, the art, the culture, indeed, of China
      has never been woven into our heritage. It is strange, in a way&mdash;we
      derived our religion from certain primitive tribes in Syria. But they had
      little culture. The Christian religion teaches conduct but very nearly
      ignores beauty. And then there is our insistent pushing forth of the
      Individual. I have come to believe that our West will seem less crass,
      less materialistic, when the individual is somewhat subdued.&rdquo; He smiled.
      &ldquo;We need patience&mdash;sheer quality of thought&mdash;the fine art of
      reflection. We shall not find these qualities at their best, even in
      Europe. They exist, in full flower, only in China. And America doesn't
      know that. Not now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little later he said: &ldquo;That work has been begun, of course, in a small
      way. A slight sense of Chinese culture is creeping into our colleges, here
      and there. Some of the poetry is bring translated. The art museums are
      reaching out for the old paintings. The Freer collection of paintings will
      some day be thrown open to the public. But traditions grow very slowly. It
      will take a hundred years to make America aware of China as it is now
      aware of Italy, Egypt, Greece, even old Assyria.... and the thing must be
      freed from Japanese influence&mdash;we can't much longer afford to look at
      wonderful, rich old China through the Japanese lens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' you're going to make tha' your work,&rdquo; observed Hui Fei.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must. I begin to feel that it is to be the only final explanation of my
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence. Then, abruptly, in a tone he did not understand, she
      asked: &ldquo;Are you going to work for the Revolution?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the immediate thing&mdash;yes. I shall offer my services.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coul' I do anything, you think? At Shanghai, I mean? Of course, I'm a
      Manchu girl, but I can no' stand with the Manchu Gover'ment. I am not even
      with my&mdash;my father there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is possible. I don't know. We shall soon be there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you tell me then&mdash;at Shanghai?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He inclined his head. Suddenly he couldn't speak. She was holding to him,
      as if it were a matter of course; yet he dared not read into her attitude
      a personal meaning of the only sort that could satisfy his hungry heart.
      The difficulty lay in his active imagination. Like that of an eager boy it
      kept racing ahead of any possible set of facts. All he could do, of
      course, was to go on curbing it, from hour to hour. It would be harder
      seeing her at Shanghai than running away, as he had half-consciously been
      planning. But it was something that she clung to him as a friend. He
      mustn't, couldn't, really, fail her there.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of the last day they sailed the wide and steadily widening estuary.
      The lead-colored water was roughened by the following wind that drove the
      junk rapidly on toward her journey's end. But toward sunset wind and sea
      died down, and under sweeps, late in the evening-, the craft moved into
      the Wusung River and moored for the night within sight of a line of
      war-ships.
    </p>
    <p>
      A feeling of companionship grew strongly among those fugitives, yellow and
      white, as the evening advanced. They had passed together through dangerous
      and dramatic scenes. Now that danger and drama were alike, it seemed,
      over, with the peaceable shipping of all the world lying just ahead up the
      narrow channel, with, in the morning to come, a fresh view of the bund at
      Shanghai, where hotels, banks and European clubs elbowed the great trading
      hongs, with motor-cars and Sikh police and the bright flags of the home
      land so soon to be spread before their weary eyes, they gathered on the
      after gallery to chat and watch the flashing signal lights of the cruisers
      and the trains on the river bank, and dream each his separate dream. Even
      Dixie Carmichael, though herself untouched by sentiment, joined, for
      reasons of policy, the little party. Hui Fei was there, between Doane and
      the moodily silent Rocky Kane. The Chinese servants smilingly grouped
      themselves on the deck just above. And finally&mdash;though it is custom
      among these Easterners to sleep during the dark hours and rise with the
      morning light&mdash;his excellency appeared, walking alone over the deck,
      smiling in the friendliest fashion and greeting them with hands clasped
      before his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane felt a little hand steal for a moment into his with a nervous
      pressure. His own relief was great.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this smiling gentleman could hardly be regarded as one about to die.
      They placed him in the steamer chair of woven rushes from Canton. And
      pleasantly, then, their last evening together passed in quiet talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      His excellency was in reminiscent mood. He had been a young officer, it
      transpired, in the T'aiping Rebellion, and had fought during the last
      three years of that frightful thirteen-year struggle up and down the great
      river, taking part in the final assault on Su-chau as a captain in the
      &ldquo;Ever Victorious&rdquo; army of General Gordon. Regarding that brilliant English
      officer he spoke freely; Doane translating a sentence, here and there, for
      young Kane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gordon never forgave Li Hung Chang,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for the murder of the
      T'ai-ping Wangs, during the peace banquet. It was on Prince Li's own
      barge, in the canal by the Eastern Gate of the city. Gordon claimed that
      Li procured the murder. He was a hot-blooded man, Gordon, often too quick
      and rough in speech. Li told me, years later, that the attack was directed
      as much against himself as against the Wangs, and regarded himself as
      fortunate to escape. He never forgave Gordon for his insulting speech. But
      Gordon was a vigorous brave man. It was a privilege to observe him
      tirelessly at work, planning by night, fighting by day&mdash;organizing,
      demanding money, money, money&mdash;with great energy moving troops and
      supplies. He could not be beaten. He was indeed the 'Ever Victorious.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was, later, his excellency who asked Hui Fei and young Kane to sing the
      American songs that had floated on one or two occasions through his window
      below. They complied; and Dixie Carmichael, in an agreeable light voice,
      joined in. At the last Duane was singing bass.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party was breaking up&mdash;his excellency had already gone below&mdash;when
      Rocky, moved to the point of exquisite pain, caught the hand of Hui Fei.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Just a word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now. I mus' go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;it's our last evening&mdash;I've tried to be patient&mdash;it'll
      be all different at Shanghai&mdash;I can't let you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she slipped away, leaving the youth whispering brokenly after her. He
      leaned for a long time on the rail then, looking heavily at the winking
      lights of the cruisers. It was a relief to see Mr. Doane coming over the
      deck. Certainly he couldn't sleep. Not now. His heart was full to
      breaking.... The fighting impulse rose. During this past day or so he had
      seemed to be losing ground in his struggle with self. The startling
      incident in Miss Carmichael's room had turned out, he felt, still
      confusedly, as a defeat. It had left him unhappy. This night, out there in
      the blossom-scented gallery, he had sensed the strange girl, close at
      hand, cool as a child, singing the old college songs with apparent quiet
      enjoyment, as an uncanny thing, a sinister force. Even when speaking to
      Hui Fei, her influence had enveloped him.... This would be just one more
      little battle. And it must be won.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly he told Mr. Doane the story. The older man considered it,
      slowly nodding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is probably the fact,&rdquo; he said, at length, &ldquo;that she stole the pearls
      at Huang Chau. She was with Connor and Watson. But it is also a fact that
      she might have pearls of her own. And in traveling alone through a
      revolution it would be her right to conceal them as she chose. It is true,
      too, that unset pearls couldn't be identified easily, if at all. And she
      is clever&mdash;she wouldn't weaken under charges.... No, I don't see what
      we can do, beyond watching the thing closely. As for her threats against
      you, they are partly rubbish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Rocky cared little, now, what they might be. Once again he had cleaned
      the black slate of his youth. His head was high again. He could speak to
      Hui Fei convincingly in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      His excellency, alone in his cabin, took from his hand-bag the book of
      precepts of Chuang Tzü; and seated on his pallet, by the small table on
      which burned a floating wick in its vessel of oil, read thoughtfully as
      follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chuang Tzü one day saw an empty skull, bleached but intact, lying on the
      ground. Striking it with his riding whip, he cried, 'Wert thou once some
      ambitious citizen whose inordinate yearnings brought him to this pass?&mdash;some
      statesman who plunged his country into ruin and perished in the fray?&mdash;some
      wretch who left behind him a legacy of shame?&mdash;some beggar who died
      in the pangs of hunger and cold? Or didst thou reach this state by the
      natural course of old age?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he had finished speaking, he took the skull and, placing it under
      his head as a pillow, went to sleep. In the night he dreamt that the skull
      appeared to him and said: 'You speak well, sir; but all you say has
      reference to the life of mortals and to mortal troubles. In death there
      are none of these.... In death there is no sovereign above, and no subject
      below. The workings of the four seasons are unknown. Our existences are
      bounded only by eternity. The happiness of a king among men can not exceed
      that which we enjoy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chuang Tzü, however, was not convinced, and said: 'Were I to prevail upon
      God to allow your body to be born again, and your bones and flesh to be
      renewed, so that you could return to your parents, to your wife and to the
      friends of your youth, would you be willing?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At this the skull opened its eyes wide and knitted its brows and said:
      'How should I cast aside happiness greater than that of a king, and mingle
      once again in the toils and troubles of mortality?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He closed the book; laid on the table his European watch; and sat for a
      long time in meditation. As the hands of the watch neared the hour of
      three in the morning, he took from the bag a box of writing materials, a
      small red book and a bottle of white pills.
    </p>
    <p>
      The leaves of the book were the thinnest gold. On one of these he
      inscribed, with delicate brush, the Chinese characters meaning
      &ldquo;Everlasting happiness.&rdquo; Tearing out the leaf, then, he wrapped loosely in
      it one of the pills&mdash;these were morphine, of the familiar sort
      manufactured in Japan and sold extensively in China since the decline of
      the opium traffic&mdash;and swallowed them together. He inscribed and took
      another, and another, and another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually a sense of drowsy comfort, of utter physical well-being, came
      over him. The pupils of his eyes shrunk down to the merest pin-points. His
      head drooped forward. His frail old body fell on the bed and lay
      peacefully there as his spirit sought its destiny in the unchanging,
      everlasting Tao.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII&mdash;HIS EXCELLENCY SPEAKS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was daybreak.
      Doane, standing in his cabin by the opened window, looked out with
      melancholy in his deep-set eyes over the muddy low reaches that border the
      Wusung. It was a familiar scene; indeed he knew it better than any spot in
      his native land&mdash;the railroad along the bank, the brick warehouses,
      the native village of Wusung, the inevitable humble families in the fields
      gathering in the last crops of the season.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overhead the <i>laopan</i> was shouting, tackle creaked, the crew half
      sang, half grunted their chanties. From the cruisers, one after another,
      floating musically on the still air, came the call of bugles&mdash;the <i>reveille</i>
      of the American navy. So these were ships from home. The stars and stripes
      would soon, at &ldquo;colors,&rdquo; be rippling from each gray stem.... There was an
      ache in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then other noises came&mdash;a little confusion of them, somewhere here on
      the junk&mdash;excited whispers, a sound that might have been sobbing, and
      then&mdash;yes!&mdash;the low wailing of women.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned; listened closely. Light feet came running along the corridor. A
      familiar, lovely voice called his name, brokenly. Then Hui Fei drew aside
      his curtain. Her cheeks were stained with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quickly, his arm about her shoulders as she swayed unsteadily, but without
      a word, he walked beside her along the corridor to the cabin of his
      excellency.... There were the few servants, kneeling by the inert body and
      bowing their heads to the floor as they mourned. Doane straightened the
      body and closed the eyes.... It was Hui Fei who found the roll of
      documents on the table and placed them in Doane's hands. He saw then,
      through the mist that clouded his own eyes, that they were addressed to
      himself: &ldquo;To my dear friend, Griggsby Doane, I entrust these my last
      papers.&rdquo; The name alone was in English; written in a clear hand, not
      unlike that of a painstaking schoolboy, each letter carefully and roundly
      formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hui Fei sent the servants to another cabin, but remained herself, seated
      on the floor by the side of the huge strong man who was now without
      question the head of the strangely assorted family. She was calmer. Doane
      did not again hear her sob; he did not even see tears. During that
      difficult moment when Rocky Kane appeared in the doorway and asked
      huskily, sadly, if he could help, she even smiled, very faintly, very
      gently, as she moved her head in the negative. And the youth, after a
      hesitant moment, left them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane spread out the documents on the floor. The first, addressed directly
      to himself, he laid aside for the moment. To the second, addressed to the
      throne&mdash;&ldquo;by the hand of His Imperial Highness, Prince Ch'un, Regent,
      as soon as it may be possible to convey to him in this hour of China's
      sorrow this inadequate expression of my last thoughts&rdquo;&mdash;was attached
      a paper requesting that &ldquo;my closest friend, Griggsby Doane&rdquo; read it
      thoughtfully, &ldquo;in order that he may understand fully the circumstances in
      which I find myself at this the end of my long life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, your unworthy servant,&rdquo;&mdash;it read&mdash;&ldquo;have learned with sorrow
      and tears of the decree permitting me to withdraw from this troubled life
      in solitude and peace without the painful consequences of a death by the
      headsman's sword. And in bowing humbly to your will I, your unworthy
      servant, recognize that my life lies wholly in your hands to be disposed
      of as seems best to the imperial wisdom. But in thus proving my never
      weakening loyalty to the imperial will I also must express the sober
      thoughts of one who has pondered long over the evils that beset our land
      and who has ventured at times, weakly, to hope that China might pay heed
      to certain lessons of recent history and find a way to oppose successfully
      the pressure of other powerful nations upon us. For it has been my
      privilege, as a long-time servant of the throne, to observe certain of
      these other nations at first hand and to learn a little of their power,
      which is very great.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On another occasion I, your unworthy servant, wittingly incurred danger
      of death or imprisonment, because, in the eagerness of my convictions, I
      dared to suggest certain reforms to the throne. There is a saying that the
      tree which bends before the gale will never be broken off but will grow to
      a ripe old age, and my hope has always been for a great and growing China.
      At that time princes and ministers about the throne asked permission to
      subject me to a criminal investigation, but his late majesty was pleased
      to spare me. Therefore my last years have been a boon at the hand of his
      late majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There followed a clear, dignified statement of the urgent need for vast
      reforms. His excellency recalled in detail his long years of service and
      his decorations and honors. Quietly he called attention to the fact that
      all, or nearly all, China was in revolt, that the throne tottered, that to
      permit the government longer to be dominated by corrupt eunuchs was an
      affront to modern as to ancient thought and morality. It was clear to
      himself, he stated, that without a skilfully organized system of gradual,
      perhaps rapid, modernization, China would soon crumble to pieces under the
      heel of the greedy foreigners. And there was profound pathos in the
      passing remark that perhaps his suicide, far from home, his vast estate
      seized by government agents or despoiled by robbers, his person, alone,
      beyond the reach of harm&mdash;safe, in fact, with the hated foreigners&mdash;might
      stand as a final proof of his loyalty to the throne in serving which his
      long life had been spent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But at the moment of leaving this world I feel that my mind is not so
      clear as I could wish. The text of this my memorial is ill-written and
      lacking in clarity of thought. I am no such scholar as the men of olden
      times; how, then, could I face the end with the calm which they showed?
      But there is a saying, 'The words of a dying man are good.' Though I am
      about to die, it is possible that my words are not good. I can only hope
      that the empress and the emperor will pity my last sad utterance,
      regarding it neither as wanton babbling nor the careless complaint of a
      trifling mind. Thus shall I die without regret. I wish, indeed, that my
      words may prove overwrought, in order that those who come after, perhaps
      more happily, may laugh at my foolishness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray the empress and the emperor to remember the example of our great
      rulers of the past in tempering peace with mercy; that they may choose
      only the worthy for public service; that they may refrain from striving
      for those things desired by the foreigners, which would only plunge China
      into deeper woe, but that by a careful study of what is good in foreign
      lands they may help China to hold up her head among the nations and bring
      us finally to prosperity and happiness. This is my last prayer, the end
      and crown of my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The junk was moving up the river as Doane finished reading, passing one of
      the war-ships. The bugles were blowing again. A beam of warm sunlight
      slanted in through the window of stained glass and threw a kaleidoscope of
      color on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hui Fei sat motionless, her hands folded humbly in her lap, gazing at the
      floor. Her face was expressionless. She seemed wholly Oriental.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sigh, Deane rolled the memorial and tied it with the ribbon. The
      one beneath it, he saw now, was addressed to Hui Fei. Without a word he
      handed it to her and then settled to read his own. Hers was the shorter.
      When she had finished she lowered it to her lap and sat motionless, as
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane now took up the paper addressed to himself and read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend, Griggsby Doane, grieve not for me, and be sure that in the
      manner of my end I have had no wish to bring evil upon you. It is in a
      measure sad that this end should come upon a hired junk instead of on a
      plot of hallowed ground, as I would have chosen. But there was no choice.
      I have waited until assured of my daughter's safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inform the magistrate at Shanghai of my death, and see that my Memorial
      to the Throne is forwarded promptly. Give to my daughter Hui Fei the
      letter addressed to her. It my wish that you also should read that letter,
      and I have so instructed her. It is also my wish that she should read this
      letter to you. Buy for me a cheap coffin, and have it painted black
      inside. The poor clothes I wear must serve, but I wish that the soiled
      soles of my shoes be cut off. Twenty or thirty taels will be ample for the
      coffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not believe it will be necessary for the magistrate to hold an
      inquest. Please have a coating of lacquer put on the coffin, to fill up
      any cracks, and have the cover nailed down pending the throne's decision
      as to my remains. Then buy a small plot of ground near the Taoist temple
      outside of Shanghai and have me buried as soon as possible. There is no
      need to consider waiting for an opportunity to bury me at my ancestral
      home; any place is good enough for a loyal and honest man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find about a thousand taels in my bag, also the few jewels we
      found at my home. Sell the jewels and keep for yourself the balance that
      will remain after my burial expenses are paid. The <i>laopan</i> of this
      junk has his money. This he will deny, and will cry for more; but do not
      heed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember there is nothing strange or abnormal in my passing; death has
      become my duty. It may be true that the historic throne of the Manchus is
      rocking, is falling, but despite the understanding that has been given to
      me of what is good in Western civilization I have never swayed in my heart
      from loyalty to that throne and steadfast devotion to its best interests
      as I can see them, and I do no less than obey the mandate of my empress
      and my emperor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not grieve unduly for me. It is my wish that all of you, my friends
      and family, should live happily in the life that lies before you. To you,
      Griggsby Doane, out of the gratitude and admiration of my proud heart, I
      give and bequeath all the little that may be left of my worldly goods,
      including the money, the pitiful handful of jewels, the historic paintings
      and my daughter Hui Fei. It is my wish that you will marry her at once,
      and that in your best judgment you sell any or all of the paintings to
      provide what money you and she may need, and also that you and she care
      lovingly for the younger child. It may be better to educate her in the
      Western manner, but that will be as you may decide. In the matter of this
      marriage with my daughter, Hui Fei, I have sought the opinion of each of
      you regarding the other. I have your assurance that it has been your own
      wish. And Hui Fei informs me that she respects and admires no man more
      than yourself. You will see, therefore, that I have approached this matter
      in the Western spirit, and as a result I see no reason why the marriage
      should be delayed or that my beloved daughter should be left alone at the
      mercy of an unscrupulous world. I have informed her, also, of my decision.
      My gifts to you make a most inadequate dowry, but they are all I have. I
      wish for you both great happiness and many descendants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Griggsby Doane, my dear friend, I take my leave of you. I, at
      seventy-four years of age, can claim an unsullied record. My family tree
      goes back more than seven hundred years; for three centuries there have
      been members of my clan in the Imperial Household or in the Government
      Bureaus, and for four hundred years we have devoted ourselves to husbandry
      and scholarship. For twenty-four generations my family has borne a good
      name. I die now in order that a lifetime of devotion to duty and loyalty
      to the throne may be consummated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly Doane lowered the document. He could not speak; he could hardly
      think. There beside him, still motionless, sat the young woman who was
      now, by all the traditions of her people, abruptly his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dutifully, observing that he had finished reading, she gave him her own
      letter; and he, in exchange, handed her his. Thus they read on. And then,
      again quietly exchanging the documents, they sat without a word by the
      peaceful body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little Doane's brain cleared. It was a time, he felt&mdash;<i>the</i>
      time, indeed&mdash;when all his experience, all his character and skill,
      must come into use. Now, it ever, he must be wise and steady and kind.
      Very gently he took her hand; it lay softly in his; she did not lift her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will not think of this matter now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Our only thought must be
      to carry out his plans regarding the funeral. If it shouldn't seem best,
      later, to fulfill quite all his last wishes, perhaps he, from the other
      side of the barrier, will understand what he couldn't wholly understand
      while on this earth. But this I must say now&mdash;-whatever direction
      your life may take, try to think of me as filling, the best I can, your
      father's place. I shall hope to be your dearest friend. Lean on me. Use
      me. And be sure I will understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her slim fingers tightened once again about his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a won'erful father,&rdquo; she began, and choked a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left her there; sent in her maid to her; himself mounted to the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was well up. Other junks sailed up and down the tide. A
      bluff-bowed freighter, flying the Dutch flag, lay at anchor near one of
      the Chinese torpedo boats that had gone over to the chaotic new republic.
      The American steamers were far astern, but a motor launch flying an
      officer's flag and with blue uniforms visible under the awning, plowed by
      on her way up to the city. In the distance, up ahead, beyond the crowding
      masts and funnels of the steamers that came from all the world, could be
      seen the buildings and spires and the smoke-haze of European Shanghai....
      The bund there, within a few hours now, would be crowded with
      pony-carriages and motor-cars and over-fed tourists riding in rickshaws
      drawn by ragged coolies. The hotels would be thronging with talkative
      young women and drink-flushed men, all eagerly retailing confused and
      inaccurate news of &ldquo;the revolution&rdquo;; out at the British country club on
      Bubbling Well Road blond men would be playing tennis in flannels: and the
      gambling houses would be brightly illuminated until late at night, and the
      Chinese shopkeepers in Nanking Road would be selling their souvenir
      trinkets, their useless little boxes of coinsilver and cloisonne and
      damascene work and their painted snuff-bottles and green soapstone
      necklaces and blue-and-white pottery quite as if no troubles could ever
      arise to disturb the destiny of nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane sighed again. The last letter of his excellency was in his hand,
      held tightly; though he was not at this time aware of it. He glanced aft,
      and saw Rocky Kane standing on the gallery, among the flowers, gazing not
      forward toward the jangling, money-seeking, pleasure-mad city that is the
      principal point of contact between the culture of the West and that of the
      East, but off astern, as if endeavoring to see again the lost Yangtze
      Kiang of his glowing romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane went to him; aware, then, of the paper rolled so tightly in his
      hand, said&mdash;a huge figure, towering over the boy, his face sad and
      more than ever deeply lined, but with a grave kindliness about the eyes:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy, it is important that you and I have a talk. Suppose we sit down.&rdquo;
       He indicated the steamer chair; but Rocky insisted that he take it,
      himself dropping heavily down on the step of the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&mdash;how is she standing it?&rdquo; he asked, his troubled eyes searching
      that strong face before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As well as we could ask. It is bound to be very hard for her&mdash;especially
      during these next few days. But she has courage. And she knows he would
      wish her not to mourn.... A matter has come up that concerns you, Rocky&rdquo;&mdash;it
      was the first time he had used that familiar name; the boy's moody eyes
      brightened momentarily, and a touch of color rose in his cheeks&mdash;&ldquo;and
      I don't feel I can delay telling you about it. First, you had better let
      me read you this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had not thought, before this moment, of the necessity that he himself
      make the translation for the boy. It had to be difficult; he would have
      given much if the thing could have been managed in some less directly
      personal way; but for that matter, difficulties lay so thickly about him
      now that there was no good in so much as giving them a thought. And so&mdash;deliberately,
      with great care to find the nearly precise English equivalent of every
      obscure phrase&mdash;he read the letter through.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dared not look at the boy's face, but could not but become aware of the
      hands that twitched, clasping and unclasping, in his lap, and of the feet
      that at times nervously tapped the deck. When the task was done he quietly
      folded the paper and slipped it into a pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence grew long and trying. Doane searched and searched his own
      still confused mind for the right, the clear word; but could not, during
      these earlier moments, find it. The boy, plainly, was crushed; but behind
      the clouded eyes and the knit brows an emotional storm was gathering.
      Doane felt that. It had to come, of course. And it would have to be
      handled.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the first words were almost calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that&rdquo;&mdash;thus the brooding youth&mdash;&ldquo;so that's how it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane waited. After a little the boy sprang up. &ldquo;But in God's name, why
      didn't you tell me!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You've let me come and talk to you! You&mdash;This
      isn't fair! You've made a fool of me! You&mdash;&rdquo; Doane rose too. They
      stood side by side among the heavily scented blossoms. Doane felt moved to
      put a kindly hand on the slender shoulder beside him; but a following
      thought cautioned him that even a touch would be resented at this moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't tell you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because until I read this paper I didn't
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must have known! You told&mdash;him. Told him you loved her!
      Probably you've been telling her, too&mdash;here under my eyes. Oh, God,
      what a fool I've been.... If you'd only been square with me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not fair,&rdquo; said Doane, still very quiet. &ldquo;We must talk this out,
      but not now&mdash;not while you are angry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Angry! What in heaven's name is the sense of talking it out! It's
      settled, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's not so!&rdquo; The boy seemed to be recovering somewhat now from the
      first shock of unreason. He turned away to hide the tears in his eyes.
      &ldquo;You've admitted to her father, if not to her, that you love her.... Oh,
      why didn't I see it! Why did I have to be such an awful fool!... She knows
      it now. And you know as well as I what she'll do. She'll never go against
      her father's last wish&mdash;never. You know that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I recognize that she must be seeing it in that light now, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what's the use of talk. You <i>know!</i> For God's sake, let me
      alone, can't you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane's brows drew slowly together; but this and a note of something near
      command in his voice, were the only outward indications of the storm
      within his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not a time for either you or me to be thinking of ourselves. You
      may be sure that Hui Fei will not be thinking so. And it may help you to
      realize that this situation is difficult for me, as it is for you. It is
      true that Hui Fei's only thought, now, under the stress of this sorrow,
      will be to submit to her father's every wish. But this stress will pass.
      There is only one course to take&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me! And try to meet the thing like a man. We will wait until
      this sad business is over. We will at least try to give up thinking of
      ourselves. I will see that Hui Fei and her sister are cared for by
      friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But all the time you'll be seeing her, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must still ask you to listen and try to think clearly. As soon as it
      seems wise I will lay the situation before Hui Fei. I will try to persuade
      her that her own life is, in the last analysis, more important than even
      her father's dying wish. I believe that she&mdash;would&mdash;be happier
      with a young man like yourself than with an&mdash;older man. It is
      possible that she can be led to see that her own happiness must be a
      factor in her choice. Have you the patience and the courage to wait for
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He extended his hand. The boy looked at it, then up at the stern, but still
      kindly face; hesitated; then, with a quivering of the lip and an explosive&mdash;&ldquo;Oh
      God!&rdquo;&mdash;rushed away; walked very fast, almost ran, the length of the
      deck; made his way through the crowded waist and around the cook's well;
      and stood, his bare head thrown proudly back, in the prow, beside the
      quietly wondering <i>tai-kung</i>, staring toward the long curving sweep
      of the tree-shaded bund of Shanghai as it came gradually into view around
      the bend just below the city.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV&mdash;THE WORLD OF FACT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE yellow junk was
      now abreast the landing hulks of the great international shipping
      companies just below the city. Rocky left the bow and made his way to the
      after cabins without once lifting his somber gaze to the silent figures on
      the poop. Slowly&mdash;his eyes wild, his thoughts beyond control,
      bitterness in his heart&mdash;he moved along the dim corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      A puff of wind found its way through an open window; a blue curtain swung
      out, discovering, through a doorway, Miss Carmichael, seated in a chair
      beneath the window. It was lighter in her cabin. She had laid aside the
      familiar middy blouse and skirt, and appeared to be sewing something on
      her petticoat. For an instant she looked up, her eyes meeting those of the
      pale youth who stood motionless in the corridor. The curtain swung back
      then; but as it swung the youth stepped through the doorway and stood
      within the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know that I asked you in,&rdquo; said she coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes were intent on the amazing, glistening strings of pearls that
      were looped everywhere about her clothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through narrowed lids she watched him, sitting very still, needle poised
      just as she had drawn it through. On his young face was an expression of
      firm decision that she had not before seen there. He looked oddly, now,
      like his father. There was, apparently, a trace of the Kane iron in him.
      The situation was of wholly accidental origin; he couldn't have planned
      it; his first expression, out in the corridor, had been of startled
      surprise; the decision to step within must have been instant; yet now,
      suddenly, he meant business. She caught all that.... Here, after all, was
      a young man who presented difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take off those pearls,&rdquo; said he quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in my room,&rdquo; said she as quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall take the pearls when I go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have my life to answer for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your life is nothing to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your own life is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've warned you fairly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You propose to take them from me by force?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Unless you choose to give them to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you expect me to trust you with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you are stronger than I,&rdquo; she observed musingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He offered no reply to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her thin mouth curved into the faint smile that was as cold as her
      calculating brain. &ldquo;So&rdquo;&mdash;said she &ldquo;we're enemies, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This evidently did not interest him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she went on, quietly desperate, &ldquo;that I'll try crying and
      screaming. I'm something of an actress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scream your head off,&rdquo; said he, the slang phrase sounding almost
      courteous in this new quiet voice of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's not a person&mdash;alive&mdash;that could prove these pearls
      aren't my own.&rdquo; Her voice dwelt on that one telling word, &ldquo;alive,&rdquo; with an
      almost caressing note of satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head with a touch of impatience. And she was studying him,
      her quick thoughts darting sharply about&mdash;-darting in every
      conceivable direction&mdash;for an avenue of escape. She knew, however, as
      the moments passed and the pale youth stood his ground that there was only
      one. She had supposed him weak. It hardly seemed that her judgment could
      have gone so far wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're cruel to me,&rdquo; she said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now she obeyed. He drew near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't think you'd turn out this sort, Rocky. You liked me at first.&rdquo;
       She moved a hand, hesitatingly, within reach of his own. But he ignored
      it. &ldquo;Aren't we going to see each other at Shanghai? Are you just going to
      be brutal with me&mdash;like this?.... I'd like to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you take them off,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;or must I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned to him, with curiously mixed passions coming to life in her
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my God, Rocky!&rdquo; she cried very low, &ldquo;haven't you any human feelings?
      Can you just come in here&mdash;into my own room&mdash;and rob me, without
      a decent word?.... Haven't I played fair with you? Haven't I kept out of
      your way? Haven't I?....&rdquo; She moved close against him, slid her
      sensitively thin hands over his shoulders; looked straight up into his
      eyes, almost honestly. &ldquo;Rocky, don't tell me you're this kind!&rdquo;.... She
      was clinging to him now.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught her hands, and, without roughness but with his young strength,
      removed them. She let them fall at her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not going to wait much longer on you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're hard as nails, Rocky.&rdquo; Her underlip was quivering; her pale eyes
      were a little darker, and seemed full of feeling. She turned suddenly to
      the rough bed, and reached under the cover for her shopping bag. Hiding it
      from him with her body, she opened it and took out the triangular bottle;
      then lingered an instant to look at the clasps of the pearl cape that were
      set with large, perfectly cut diamonds. There were five of the clasps, and
      perhaps fifty of the sparkling, glittering stones. In value they would
      vary somewhat-: but in themselves, even without the pearls, they
      represented a fortune. She quietly closed the bag and replaced it under
      the covers.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the rough-edged little bottle in her hand she faced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew a girl,&rdquo; she said, with a far-away look in her eyes, &ldquo;who took
      five of these tablets and then lived two days. She suffered terribly,
      of....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught the bottle from her hand and threw it against the wall, where it
      broke. The green pills rolled about the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; she remarked&mdash;&ldquo;I can take them after you've gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After I've gone you can do as you think best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But something will have to be done about me. Rocky. You'll have to get me
      ashore. And see about burying me.... And you'll have to explain me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This moved him not at all. Apparently he <i>was</i> to be one of the Kanes&mdash;strong,
      pitiless, destined for success and power. There would be weak moments; but
      all that her uncannily shrewd eyes saw in him. For that matter, Miss
      Carmichael had known many men of the sort that in America are termed &ldquo;big&rdquo;&mdash;certain
      of them with an unpleasant secret intimacy&mdash;and each had possessed
      and (at moments) been possessed by strong passions. It had never been
      wholly a matter of what is called brain; always there had been emotional
      force, with a dark side as well as a bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overhead the great clumsy sails creaked. Soft feet pattered about the
      deck. The nasal voices of the crew broke into a chantey. A chain rattled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must be there,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;We're anchoring, I think.&rdquo; And she glanced
      out the window at one of the roofed-over opium hulks that lay in those
      days directly opposite the bund. Finally she looked again at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said then; and raised her arms above her head. Swiftly,
      at once, he began stripping off the festoons of pearls. The only other
      thing said was her remark, in a casual tone: &ldquo;It's understood that you're
      using force. And you'll hear from it, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he had gone she slipped into her blouse and skirt. Once again
      she looked thoughtfully at the radiant gems that were left to her; then
      went, coolly swinging the little bag, up on deck, where certain of the
      crew were already drawing around to the ladder at the side the sampan that
      had been towing astern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rocky had gone directly, on tiptoe, to Doane's cabin. The huge sad-faced
      man was there; quick, however, with a kindly smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rocky said&mdash;&ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir?&rdquo;&mdash;stiffly, not unlike a
      proud young Briton&mdash;and from a tied-up handkerchief and bulging
      pockets&mdash;even from his shirt above his tightly drawn belt&mdash;produced
      enormous quantities of perfectly matched large pearls; laid them on the
      bed in a heap; helped Mr. Doane make a bundle of them in a square of blue
      cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are yours, sir,&rdquo; he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      He withdrew then, with a coldness of manner that to the older man was
      moving; and went out on deck to await his turn in the sampan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane found a temporary home for Hui Fei and her sister at the mission
      compound of his friend, Doctor Henry Withery, in the Chinese city; himself
      lodging with other friends. Rocky went to the Astor House, across Soochow
      Creek, which was still, in 1911, a famous stopping place for the tourists,
      diplomats, military and commercial men, and all the other more prosperous
      among the white travelers that pour into Shanghai from everywhere else in
      the world by the great ships that plow unceasingly the Pacific and Indian
      Oceans and the Yellow and China Seas; to pour out again (in peaceful
      times) from Shanghai by rail and by lesser craft of the river and the
      coast to Hong Kong and Manila to Hankow, to Tientsin and Peking, to
      Nagasaki, Kobe, Yokohoma and Tokio.... and Shanghai had never been so
      crowded as now, with its thousands of travelers detained, awaiting news
      from this or that revolutionary center; with the American Marines and the
      British and German sailors; with Manchu refugees swarming into the foreign
      settlements; with revolutionists, queueless, wearing unaccustomed European
      dress, parading everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane found time to call at the hotel and leave word regarding the burial
      of his excellency; but was not to know that Rocky, himself, immured in his
      room, gave the word that he was out and there awaited the friendly chit
      that Doane sent up by the blue-robed servant. Nor was he to know that the
      boy dressed carefully for the ceremony, only to find the ordeal too great
      for his overstrung emotions. It was as an afterthought, a day or two later
      that Doane sent him Hui Fei's address.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after this sad experience that Doane, in accordance with his
      promise to the late Sun Shi-pi, called on Doctor Wu Ting Fang and offered
      his services to the revolutionary party. Another day and he was hard at
      work, bending his strong, finely trained and experienced mind to the great
      task of presenting the dreams and the activities of Young China fairly and
      sympathetically to the press and the governments of the Western World....
      And so Griggsbv Doane, concealing&mdash;at moments almost from his own
      inner eye&mdash;the ache in his heart, the unutterable loneliness of his
      solitary existence, found himself once more fitting into the scheme of
      organized human life. A grave man, with sad eyes but with a slow kindly
      smile, always courteously attentive to the person and problem of the
      moment, thinking always clearly and objectively out of a comprehensively
      tolerant background that seemed to include all nations and all men; a
      gently tactful man; a tireless, powerful figure of a man, who could work
      twenty hours on end without a trace of fatigue, going through masses of
      minor detail without for a moment losing his broad view of the major
      problems&mdash;such was the Griggsby Doane one saw at revolutionary
      headquarters during that late autumn of 1911.... Life had caught him up.
      Whatever his private sorrow, the world needed him now. Rapidly, in all
      that confusion, he was formulating policies, helping to direct the current
      of one stream of destiny. In past years Griggsby Doane had been discussed
      and forgotten. He had even been laughed at as an unfrocked missionary by
      ribald, dominant, not infrequently drunken whites along the coast. It
      occurred to no one to laugh at him now.

      These were the days when in half the provincial capitals of China the
      Manchus that had ruled during nearly three centuries were hunted to their
      death, men and women alike, like vermin. Bloody heads decorated the lamp
      posts that had been erected in the Western fashion beside freshly
      macadamized streets. Slaughter, as in other dramatic moments in Oriental
      history, had become a pastime. Palaces and wealthy homes in a hundred
      cities were looted and burned, and a vast new traffic started up in the
      silks and paintings and pottery and objects of art suddenly thrown into
      the market.... Hankow had been taken by the imperial troops, but was to be
      recaptured as a charred, gutted ruin. General Li Yuan-hung was now
      &ldquo;president of the Republic of China,&rdquo; up at Wu Chang, by right of military
      organization and popular acclaim. Admiral Sah, of the Imperial Navy, was
      about to witness the unanimous mutiny of his fleet. The great Yuan
      Shi-K'ai, himself a Chinese born, was in command of the imperial troops
      while negotiating on either hand with the frantic throne and the upsurging
      revolutionists. At Peking heads were falling and great princes were
      fleeing or hiding pitifully within the walls of the legations.... Within a
      few weeks Sun Yat Sen was to leave London on his long journey eastward by
      way of Suez and Singapore, but without the enormous golden treasure so
      confidently expected by the revolutionists. Before his arrival, even, he
      was to be elected president of the new China, in the recently captured
      Nanking&mdash;where a National Assembly in cropped heads and frock coats
      already would be grinding out fresh tangles of legislation.... The event
      was outrunning the mental capacity of man. What was now tragic confusion
      would grow through the swift-following years into tragic chaos, as the
      most numerous and most nearly inert of peoples struggled out of the
      sluggish habit of centuries toward the dubious light of modernity.
    </p>
    <p>
      But through the chaos Griggsby Doane was never for a moment to lose the
      new vision that had finally cleared his long troubled mind. Behind the
      crumbling of the empire, underlying the torn and bleeding surface of
      Chinese life, lay a tradition finer, he was to believe until his dying
      day, than any so far developed in the truculent West&mdash;a delicate
      responsiveness to beauty in nature and art, a reflective quality, an
      instinct for peace&mdash;it was all these at once, and more; a blend of
      art in living and living in art; a finish that was exquisite in concept, a
      sensitiveness that lifted the soul of man above the ugly fact. Even the
      brittle perfection of Chinese etiquette&mdash;regulating every passing
      human contact, clothing in silken manner the naked thought&mdash;was like
      a fine lacquer over the knotted wood of life... America, he felt, with all
      its earnestly insistent young virtues, worshiped the fact. To the
      Americans must be preached the gospel of sensitive thought, of reflective
      enjoyment of the beautiful. Those old master painters of Tang and Sung
      breathed beauty; it was sweet air in their lungs; whereas in America
      beauty was too often like a garment to be bought in a shop and worn for
      show.... Yes, this revolutionary work was a gratifying opportunity for
      service, of great momentary importance because the Chinese people must be
      rescued from Manchu conquerors and their eunuchs, from disease and famine,
      and from ignorance of the new world that had come amazingly, brutally,
      into being while the old Middle Kingdom slumbered; but it was not the main
      work. The aggressively greedy West, now, with its merchants and war-ships
      and armies, was destroying the soul of China even while teaching her a
      smattering of the materialistic new faith. There must be a
      counter-influence; as the East now so strongly felt the West, so must be
      the West made sensitively aware of the East. It was fair give and take. It
      might yet help the world to find a stable balance.... This was what the
      difficult life of Griggsby Doane was coming to mean. The East had crept
      into his heart. So he must turn back to the West.
    </p>
    <p>
      For three days Mr. Doane's brief chit&mdash;with the address of Hui Fei in
      the native city&mdash;burned in Rocky Kane's pocket; then, early in the
      third afternoon, he went down to the Japanese steamship offices (for the
      keen little brown people had already captured the Pacific traffic from the
      Americans) and bought the second officer's room on a crowded liner leaving
      at the end of the week for San Francisco.... On the fourth afternoon he
      called a rickshaw and rode out beyond the American post-office to the
      address the older man had given him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Doane, it appeared, was not in; already he was established at
      Doctor Wu's revolutionary headquarters. Rocky considered driving there;
      even took the address and rode part of the way: but reconsidered, returned
      to the hotel, and sent a messenger to Hui Fei with this chit:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I'm sailing Saturday. Do you feel that you could see me for a few
      moments?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reply, within the hour, bade him come. He found her in Western dress&mdash;-a
      tailored suit, very simple; her glistening black hair parted smoothly&mdash;as
      he would always most vividly remember it&mdash;gently sad in manner, yet
      able to smile. She would be like that, come to think of it; not crushed by
      the tragedy, not sunken in the grief that, among Westerners, is so often a
      sort of histrionic egotism.... They sat in a tiled courtyard among
      dahlias. More than ever like a proud young Briton was Rocky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is good of you to see me.&rdquo; Thus he began.... &ldquo;I couldn't go without a
      word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She murmured then: &ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to know, too, that I am coming to see&rdquo;&mdash;he had to pause;
      in this new phase of sober young manhood he had not yet achieved steady
      self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      She broke the silence with a question about the revolution. It is to his
      credit that he talked, stumbling only at first, clearly. And as the strain
      of the meeting gradually relaxed, he became aware of her sobered but still
      intense absorption in the struggle; aware, too, increasingly, of her
      strong gift of what is called personality. Her mind was quick, bright,
      eager&mdash;better, it seemed (he had to fight bitterness here) than his
      own. And she was impersonal to a degree that he couldn't yet attain&mdash;couldn't,
      in fact, quite understand. He had to speak slowly and carefully; feeling
      his way with a dogged determination among uprushing emotions, moved as
      never before by the charm of appearance and manner and speech of which she
      was so prettily unconscious.... He had come&mdash;perhaps with more than a
      touch in him of (again) that Western histrionism, the intense
      overstressing of the individual and his feelings&mdash;as a man who was
      effacing himself that the woman he loved might be happy with another man.
      Confused with this wholly unconscious call upon the sympathies,
      undoubtedly, was an unphrased incredulity that she&mdash;so strongly a
      person, fine and courageous and outstanding as he knew her to be&mdash;could
      accept this being almost casually left as part of a legacy to that other
      man. It was incredible. Unless she loved the other man.... So he came
      around again to the personal; unaware, of course, that he was feeling
      inevitably with his strongly individualistic race. Even when she dwelt on
      race, a little later in their talk, he found no light. He couldn't have;
      for the American seldom can see what lies outside himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don' know yet what I can do,&rdquo; she was saying, very honestly and simply
      (they hadn't yet mentioned Mr. Doane). &ldquo;Of course I'm a Manchu, after all.
      An' blood does coun'. I feel that. A good many people to-day talk
      differen'ly, I know. We saw a good 'eal of Socialism at college. The
      idealists to-day&mdash;the Jews an' Russians an' even some of our Chinese
      students&mdash;the younger men&mdash;talk as if race doesn' matter. But of
      course it does. It will ta' thousan's of years, I suppose, to bring the
      races together. An' maybe it's impossible. Maybe it can' be done at all. I
      think tha's the tragedy of so much of this beautiful dreaming.... An' here
      you see I'm a Manchu, an' yet I wan' the Manchus put out of China. Because
      they won' let China grow. An' China mus' grow, or die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was moodily watching her; head bowed a little, gazing out under knit
      brows. &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it's a queer thing to say, of course, but
      sometimes you make me feel terribly young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled faintly. &ldquo;You are&mdash;rather young, Rocky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He closed his eyes and compressed his lips; his name, on her lips, was
      dangerously thrilling music to him. After a moment he went doggedly on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The crowds I've gone with at home haven't talked about these things. They
      wouldn't think it good form.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;They woul'n'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm beginning to wonder if we're&mdash;well, intelligent, exactly. You
      know&mdash;just motors and horses and girls and bridge and 'killings' in
      Wall Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Killings?&rdquo; Her brows were lifted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;picking up a lot of money, quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; she mused, &ldquo;is what I sometimes worry about. You know, I love
      America. I have foun' happiness there. I love the books an' the colleges
      and the freedom an' all the goo' times. But it is true, I think&mdash;money
      is God in America. Pipple don' like to have you say it, of course. But I'm
      afraid it is true. Ever'-thing has to come to money&mdash;the gover'men',
      the churches, ever'thing. I have seen that. That is the hard side of
      America. I don' like that so well.&rdquo; Finally&mdash;coming down, helplessly,
      on the personal, yet with a courageous light in his eyes&mdash;he said: &ldquo;I
      do want you to know this&mdash;Hui. You won't mind my speaking of my love
      for you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hand moved a very little way upward. &ldquo;Please! I can't help that. It's
      my life now. I'm full of you. And it has changed me. I'm&mdash;I'm going
      back.... I'm going at things differently. I want you to know that. Because
      if I hadn't met you it couldn't possibly have happened. And if I hadn't&mdash;well,
      learned what it means to love a wonderful girl like you. I want you to
      know how big the change is that you've made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rocky,&rdquo; she said gently&mdash;&ldquo;will you do something for me?&rdquo; He
      waited...."I wan' you to go back to college.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've already made up my mind to that,&rdquo; he replied, more quietly. &ldquo;It's
      the job for me now. It's the next thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;An' I'd love it if you'd write to me sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He inclined his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, for a moment, his old turbulent inner self unexpectedly (even to
      himself), lifted its head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried to see Mr. Doane&mdash;that is, I thought perhaps I ought to tell
      him that I was coming out here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed slightly puzzled at this. Her lips framed questioningly the
      words: &ldquo;Tell him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I perhaps can't say much&mdash;but I'm sure you and he will be
      happy. I&mdash;oh, he's a big man. He's terribly busy now, of course&mdash;you
      know what he's doing&mdash;at Wu Ting Fang's headquarters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She inclined her head rather wearily, saying: &ldquo;He wrote me a ver' kin note&mdash;jus'
      to say that he was busy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They talk about him some at the hotel. All of a sudden he seems to be a
      power here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went without a further word into the house, returning with a slip of
      paper. Into her manner had crept at the mention of Doane's name, a
      gentler, more wistful quality that she seemed not to think of concealing;
      it was even a confiding quality, intimately friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don' quite un'erstand it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;A gen'leman called from the Hong
      Kong Bank an' lef' this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rocky read the paper; a receipt for a sealed parcel of pearls and for
      other separate jewels and a sum of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;he put it all there in your name,&rdquo; said he, while a sudden new
      hope rose into his drying throat and throbbed in his temples.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It puzzle' me&mdash;a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned the paper over and over in his fingers, once again struggling to
      think.... She sat motionless, gazing at the dahlias.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blindly then he groped for her hands, found them and impulsively gripped
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hui&rdquo;&mdash;he whispered huskily&mdash;&ldquo;tell me&mdash;if it's like this&mdash;if
      you&mdash;if he.... All this time I've supposed you and he were.... I want
      you to come with me to America. We both do love it there. I'll give up my
      life to making you happy. I'll slave for you. I'll make of my life what
      you say. just let us try it together....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She silently heard him out&mdash;through this and much more, leaving her
      hands quietly in his. Finally then, when the emotional gust seemed in some
      measure to have spent itself, she said, gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rocky, I wan' you to listen to what I'm going to tell you. You said I
      make you feel young. Well&mdash;can' you see why? Can' you see that I'm
      quite an ol' lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that's nonsense! You&mdash;&rdquo; His eyes were feasting on her soft skin
      and on the exquisite curve of her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;you mus' listen! First tel me how old you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unexpectedly on the defensive, Rocky had to compose himself, arrange his
      dignity, before he could reply. &ldquo;I was twenty-one in the summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ver' good. An' I was twenty-five in the spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please! I don' know what you coul' have thought&mdash;how young you
      thought I was when I wen' to college. But tha's the way it is. I'm an ol'
      lady. I have learn' to like you ver' much. I'm fond of you. I wan' to feel
      always tha' we're frien's. But we coul'n' be happy together. Our interes'
      aren' the same&mdash;they coul'n' be. Can' you see, Rocky? If there is
      something abou' me tha' stirs you&mdash;that is ver' won'erful. But we
      mus'n' let it hurt you. An' that isn' the same as marriage. Marriage is
      differen'&mdash;there mus' be so much in common&mdash;if a man an' woman
      are to live together an' work together, they mus' think an' hope an'....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice died out. She was gazing again, mournfully at the dahlias. When
      he released her hands they lay limp in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a great effort of will he wished her every happiness, promised to
      write, and got himself away.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was on Thursday. Rocky walked at a feverish pace from the native city
      to the European settlement that was so quaintly not Chinese&mdash;more,
      with its Western-style buildings that were decorated with ornamental iron
      balconies and richly colored Chinese signs, like a &ldquo;China-town&rdquo; in an
      American city&mdash;and wandered for a time along Nanking Road; then out
      to Bubbling Well Road; away out, past the Country Club to the almost
      absurdly suburban quarter with its comfortably British villas; seeing,
      however, little of the busy life that moved about him, threading his way
      over cross-streets without a conscious glance at the motorcars and
      pony-drawn victorias (with turbanned mafoos cracking their whips) and
      bicycles and the creaking passenger wheelbarrow's on which fat native
      women with tiny stumps of feet rode precariously. For those few hours were
      to be recalled in later years as the quietly darkest in the young man's
      life. There was no question now of dissipation; he knew with the
      decisiveness of the Kanes that he had turned definitely away from the
      morbid oblivion of alcohol and opium, as from the unhealthy if exciting
      diversion of loveless women. But the bitterness would not down all at
      once. Indeed it was savagely powerful, still, to cloud his reason. The
      only evidence of victory over self of which he was aware was the fact that
      he could now look almost objectively at himself, and could fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was back at the hotel between seven and eight, but couldn't eat. For an
      hour he walked his room, locked in. Then, in sheer loneliness, a little
      afraid of himself, he went down to the spacious lounge and sat in a
      corner, behind a palm, staring at a copy of the <i>China Press</i> and
      listening, all overstrung nerves, to the cackle and laughter of the
      self-centered tourists and the curiously bold and loud commercial men from
      across the Pacific. He heard this, in his younger way, as Doane would have
      heard it, even as Hui; it was all heedless, light-brained; careless....
      Confused with the bitterness (in a bewildering degree) was a sense of the
      finely reflective atmosphere that had lately enveloped him and that he was
      not to lose easily. He felt&mdash;sitting, all nerves, in this babel&mdash;the
      fine old Chinese gentleman who had gone serenely to the death that was his
      destiny. He felt&mdash;constantly, intensely&mdash;the princess who had
      brought to her American college an instinct for culture the like of which
      neither he nor any of his friends at home had brought or found there. And
      he felt Mr. Doane&mdash;felt a spaciousness of mind in the man, a
      patience, a tolerance&mdash;felt him as a gentleman&mdash;felt him while
      still, in his heart, he was bitterly fighting him.... The thing had closed
      over his head&mdash;the sheer quality of these remarkable folk. He was
      simply out of a cruder world. He hadn't the right to stand with them&mdash;the
      simple right of character and breeding. And no amount of determination, no
      amount of storming at it could alter the fact. It would take years of
      patient work. Ever, then he might miss it; for his environment soon again
      would be that of the cackling tourists he now hated. Even at college it
      would be all the dominant athletics, the parties and the motors and girls
      and drinking, the association with those sons of prosperous families who
      were all consciously cementing alliances with the financial upper class
      that quietly ruled America while hired politicians prated and performed
      without in the smallest measure controlling or even altering the blatant
      facts.... He and his kind, at college, despised the &ldquo;grind.&rdquo; And you had
      to be a grind if you weren't the other thing. Yet Hui Pei had managed it
      differently. She was neither and both. It seemed to be a difference of
      mental texture....
    </p>
    <p>
      A slim girl, richly dressed, with a sable wrap about her shoulders and a
      pretty little hat, was threading her way among the crowding chairs and
      tables and the talkative groups in the lounge. He glanced up: then looked
      closely. It was Dixie Carmichael. She stood before him, wearing her icy,
      faintly mocking smile. He rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could only incline his head with a sort of courtesy, and contrive an
      artificial smile. He seemed to have been dreaming, outrageously. Life had
      begun now'.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm running down to Singapore,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Friends there. And a
      look-see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;indeed.&rdquo; She looked out-and-out rich; and she was
      surprisingly pretty, without a sign that she had ever known danger or even
      care.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Staying here?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I start back home Saturday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So?.... Well, that'll be pleasant.&rdquo; With a final glance of what seemed
      almost like triumph she sailed away. And he knew that in taking the pearls
      he had not taken all from her. Apparently, too, she meant him to know it.
      That would be her moment of triumph. And that was all; not a word was
      spoken regarding his violence or her threats.... He saw the yellow porters
      carrying out her luggage of bright new leather.
    </p>
    <p>
      He resumed his seat; twitched for a time with increasing nervousness; got
      up and went aimlessly over to the desk; asked the Malay clerk for mail.
    </p>
    <p>
      A smiling little Japanese appeared, rather officious about a great lot of
      bags and a trunk or two that were coming in. He had a familiar look; even
      raised his hat and stepped forward with outstretched hand. It was Kato....
      And then Dawley Kane came in&mdash;tall, quiet, neatly dressed, his nearly
      white mustache newly cropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his pale son Dawley Kane said merely&mdash;&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;&mdash;as he took his
      hand; and then was busy registering. That done, he asked: &ldquo;Had dinner?&rdquo;
       Rocky shook his head. &ldquo;I don't care for any.&rdquo; Daw ley Kane's quietly keen
      eyes surveyed his son. &ldquo;What's the matter? Not well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm well enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down with me, can't you?&rdquo; And turning to the attending Japanese he
      said: &ldquo;You'll excuse me Kato. I'll be dining with my son. And tell Mr.
      Braker, please.... Just a minute Rocky, till I wash my hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were shown to a table in the great diningroom, where the cackling was
      louder than in the lounge (they dine late on the coast)&mdash;where
      blue-gowned waiters moved softly about as if there had never been a
      revolution and wine glasses glistened and prettily bared shoulders gleamed
      roundly under the electric lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Rocky, seated gloomily opposite this powerful quiet man&mdash;who took
      him unerringly in of course; dishearteningly, Rocky felt&mdash;found
      himself in a depression deeper than any he had known before. His father
      was so strong and he brought back with him the enveloping atmosphere of
      the mighty, splendidly successful white world in which they both belonged&mdash;a
      world that crushed the heart out of weaker peoples while it blandly talked
      the moralities. He felt it as a Juggernaut. It had the amazingly
      successful racial blend of character and plausibility. That would be the
      British quality; and, more roughly and confusedly, the American.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Getting rather interesting up the river.&rdquo; remarked Dawley Kane, over his
      soup. &ldquo;How'd you get down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On a junk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been here long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Several days. I'm sailing Saturday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sailing?&rdquo; Mr. Kane raised his eyebrows. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You decided not to consult me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh.... Don't ride me, father! It's the next thing. I'm going back to
      college.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;I see.&rdquo; Mr. Kane looked over the menu, ordered his roast, and
      selected a red wine, cautioning the waiter to set it near the stove for
      five minutes. &ldquo;It's wicked to heat Burgundy,&rdquo; he said, when the waiter had
      gone, &ldquo;but it's the only way you can get it served at the right
      temperature. I discovered that when we were here before.... I gather, my
      boy, that you've come to your senses in the matter of that little yellow
      girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rocky did not wince outwardly; he merely sat still. But his mind, at last,
      was active. And he knew&mdash;saw it in a flash&mdash;that no explanation
      he could possibly make, would be intelligible. You can not&mdash;yet&mdash;talk
      across the gulf between the worlds. It was his first intelligent glimpse
      of the tremendous fact that Doane had so long and so clearly felt and
      seen. So he merely&mdash;at last, when his father looked closely at him&mdash;inclined
      his head and said, huskily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to work out this college business'. That's my job clear
      enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This new attitude was to bring, later in the evening, confidences from the
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's been an interesting journey for me, Rocky.&rdquo; Thoughtfully Dawley Kane
      smoked his Manila cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's enabled me to understand somewhat the delicate international
      situation out here. I couldn't see why our agents weren't accomplishing
      more. The trouble is, of course, that every square foot of China's staked
      out by the European nations. If you don't believe that, just get a
      concession from the Chinese Government&mdash;for a big job&mdash;water
      power development, mining, railway building, or an industrial monopoly&mdash;that
      part of it isn't so hard&mdash;and then try to carry it through. You'd
      find out fast enough who are the real owners of China. And those owners
      would never let you start. Great Britain controls this great empire of the
      Yangtze Valley as completely as she controls India. France owns the south&mdash;Russia
      the northwest and the north&mdash;Japan, from Korea and Lower Manchuria is
      penetrating the northwest, too; they're bound, the Japanese, to tip Russia
      out one of these days, and they're very clever and patient about slipping
      into the British regions. They've got the Germans to contend with, too, in
      the Kiochow region. But someday&mdash;either in the event of the final
      break-up of China or in the event of the European nations coming to an
      out-and-out squabble (which is almost a certainty, at that) Japan will be
      found to have pulled off most of the big prizes for herself. We'll have to
      fight Japan someday, I suppose&mdash;over the control of the Pacific&mdash;but
      in the meantime, those little people are the best bet. They know the East
      as the rest of us don't, they're clever, and their diplomats aren't
      hampered by the sort of half-enlightened public opinion that's always
      tripping us up in the West&mdash;sentimental idealism, that sort of thing&mdash;and
      they control their press infinitely better than we do. They've got
      everything, the Japanese, except money. And we've got the money. It'll be
      just a question of security, that's all; and watching them pretty closely.
      I've made up my mind to play it that way.... A survey of the actual
      conditions out here makes our American diplomacy look pretty naive. We
      talk idealism&mdash;open door and all&mdash;while all the rest of them are
      moving in and setting up shop and getting the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Later, in Dawley Kane's spacious suite overlooking the park-like street
      where the colored lanterns of the rickshaws glowed pleasantly under the
      trees, the father said, laying a hand affectionately on the boy's
      shoulder:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't tell you how happy you've made me, Rocky. It looks as if you'd
      turned your corner. Just don't go in for too much thinking about what
      you've been through. There's nothing in remorse. As a matter of fact, a
      little rough experience is a good thing for a boy. After you get your
      balance you'll be all the closer to life for it.... Go ahead with your
      college plans, get your degree, and then after a year or two in the New
      York office I'll bring you out here. We shall be playing for big stakes.
      And we shall need good men.... That's the whole problem, really&mdash;the
      men. I had my eyes on this man Doane, but he turned out to be only a
      sentimentalist after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the hopelessness of it that drove Rocky out&mdash;after a
      respectful good night&mdash;and over to the revolutionary headquarters. He
      knew that Mr. Doane worked most of the night; and took what sleep he got
      on a cot there.

      CHAPTER XV&mdash;IN A COURTYARD
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>E sent in his
      name, and waited for an hour in an outer office. For even at this late
      hour in the evening headquarters was a busy place. Chinese gentlemen
      crowded in and out, dressed, to a man, in the frock coats and the flapping
      black trousers they didn't know how to wear. High officers slipped quietly
      in and out&mdash;in khaki, with the white brassard of the Revolution on
      their left arms; sometimes with merely a handkerchief tied there Orderlies
      and messengers came and went. And clerks of untiring patience sat at
      desks.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a difficult hour. Rocky had only his confused emotions to guide
      him, and his hurt heart. There were moments, even, when he didn't know why
      he had come. But he never thought of giving up. Whatever their curious
      relations, he had to see Mr. Doane, who was now the only stable figure in
      the rocking world about him. The man had been fine&mdash;square. That he
      knew now. And his nervous young imagination was veering toward
      hero-worship. He was utterly humble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally he was boyish about it, when they finally led him into that
      inner office. He said, flushing a little:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you're busy, Mr. Doane&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not too busy for you. I kept you waiting to clear up a lot of things.&rdquo;
       The man's great size and calmness of manner&mdash;the question rose; had
      he ever in his life known weariness?&mdash;were comforting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm&mdash;sailing Saturday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, for a brief moment, brought the kindly though strong and sober face
      to immobility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, sir, I've come to feel that the best thing for me is to go back
      and&mdash;-start clean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A slight mist came over Doane's eyes. What a struggle the boy had had of
      it! And how splendidly he was working through!.... Thought came about the
      children of the rich in America... the problem of it....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;couldn't go without seeing you. You see, sir, it's you, I guess,
      that've put me on my feet. I sort of&mdash;well, I want you to know that I
      <i>am</i> on them. It's been a strange experience, all round. A terrible
      experience, of course. It shakes you....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has shaken me, too,&rdquo; Doane observed simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. That is, I see all that more clearly now. I was going to speak of
      it&mdash;it's one of the things, but first.... Mr. Doane, will you write
      to me? Once in a while? I mean, will you&mdash;could you find time to
      answer if I write to you? You see, it isn't going to be easy, over there.
      I've got to go clean outside my own crowd. And outside my family. They
      won't one of them understand what I'm up to. Not one. And&mdash;when you
      come right down to it, I suppose it's a question whether the thing licks
      me or not. But&rdquo;&mdash;his shoulders squared; he looked directly into that
      kind, deeply shadowed face&mdash;&ldquo;I don't believe it will lick me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Doane, &ldquo;it won't lick you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never be able to shake China off now. It's got me. And I don't
      know a thing about it yet. Of course I shall be reading and studying it
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll send you a book once in a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I know I'm coming back out here someday. But it won't be as my father
      wants me to come. You see, I'll have money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great responsibility, Rocky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. I'm beginning to see that. But&mdash;I know all this must sound
      pretty young to you!&mdash;but I'm afraid I shall be leaning on you
      sometimes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write to me at those times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is an amazing health in the American people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;that's so, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a curiously blundering people, of course. And there's a hard, really
      a Teutonic strain&mdash;that blend of practical hard-headedness, even of
      cruelty, with sentimentality&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rocky's brows came together. Mr. Doane and his father plainly didn't use
      that word &ldquo;sentimental&rdquo; in the same sense, &ldquo;&mdash;it comes down to a
      strain of&mdash;well, something between the old Anglo-Saxonism and the
      modern Prussianism. It's in us&mdash;in our driving business tactics, our
      narrow moral intolerance, our insistence on standardizing vulgar ideas&mdash;forcing
      every individual into a mold&mdash;in our extraordinary glorification of
      the salesman. We seem to have a good deal both of the British complacency
      and the rough aggressiveness of the German. But the health is there&mdash;wonderfully.
      What America needs is beauty&mdash;not the self-conscious swarming after
      it of earnest and misguided suburban ladies&mdash;but a quiet sense of the
      thing itself. Beauty&mdash;and simplicity&mdash;and patience&mdash;and
      tolerance&mdash;and faith. Prosperity has for the moment wrecked faith
      there. Simply too much money. But you'll find health growing up
      everywhere. Just let yourself grow with it. You've been deeply impressed
      by China. But if I were you, I'd let all that take care of itself. Never
      mind what you may come to feel next year or ten years from now. It may be
      mainly China or mainly America. Just work, and let yourself grow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the door they clasped hands warmly. And then, finally, Rocky got to the
      point:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Doane&mdash;this is what I wanted to say&mdash;I saw Hui Fei this
      afternoon, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane was silent; but still gripped his hand, &ldquo;&mdash;and we talked things
      all out. She knows I'm&mdash;knows I'm going back. And&mdash;this is
      it.... You don't mind my.... I think you ought to find time to go over
      there and see her. She seems puzzled about&mdash;I don't know quite how to
      say all this. You know how I've felt&mdash;feel.... Of course, the thing
      is to look the facts in the face. I hope I'm man enough to do that.&rdquo; His
      voice was unsteady now. &ldquo;I'm not the one. I never was. She was clear about
      it, to-day, but... I think you ought to see her. Oh, I'm sure it isn't
      just her father's will....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rocky found himself, without the slightest sense of ungentleness on the
      part of Mr. Doane, through the door and confusedly saying his good-by
      before the patient clerks and the waiting crowd in the anteroom. He walked
      back to the hotel with a warm glow of admiration and friendship in his
      heart. There would be&mdash;he knew, even then&mdash;sad hours, probably
      bitter hours, in the long struggle to come. But this talk was going to
      help.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Doane the boy's announcement had an almost crushing effect. His spirit
      was not adjusted to happiness. The terrific strain of the work was a
      blessing. He framed, that night and during the following day, innumerable
      little chits to Hui Fei&mdash;pretexts, all, for a visit that needed no
      pretext. And the day passed. Self-consciousness was upon him; and a
      constant mental difficulty in making the situation credible. And there was
      the pressure of time; an awareness that to Hui Fei&mdash;perhaps even to
      the Witherys&mdash;his silence would soon demand a stronger explanation
      than the mere pressure of business. He had to keep reminding himself that
      the girl was helpless, that he himself was the only guardian whose
      authority she could recognize; his reason whispering from moment to moment
      that she would not touch the money he had so promptly put at her disposal.
      No, she would wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was his old friend Henry Withery who brought him to it; appearing late
      on the Saturday afternoon, determined to drag him off for dinner....
      Withery, looking every one of his forty-eight years, patient resignation
      in the dusty blue eyes, and a fine net of wrinkles about them. His slight
      limp was the only reminder of tortures inflicted by the Boxers in 1900,
      out in Kansuh. He had taken over the T'ainan-fu mission for a year after
      Doane left the church in 1907; and during two years now had been here in
      Shanghai.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no good killing yourself here, Grig,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We've not had ten
      minutes with you yet, remember. And we must talk over that girl's affairs.
      She's very sweet about it, but it's plain that she's waiting on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His tone was genial; quite the tone of their earlier friendship, with
      nothing left of the constraint that had come into their relationship
      during Doane's difficult years on the river&mdash;the years that couldn't
      be explained, even to old friends.... And Withery knew nothing of the
      curious personal problem of his and Hui Fei's lives. His manner made that
      clear.... It remained to be seen whether Mrs. Withery knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      .... Doane, it will be noted, was still struggling, as of settled habit,
      with the thought of freeing the girl from the obligation laid upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Withery didn't know, didn't dream. She was quite her whole-souled
      self. He might have been Hui Fei's father, from anything in her manner. He
      felt a conspirator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father's tragic end accounted altogether for the girl's silence. She
      met him naturally, though, with a frank grip of the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a pleasant enough family dinner. They talked the revolution, of
      course. No one in Shanghai at the beginning of that November talked
      anything else. Hui Fei quietly listened; her face very sober in repose.
      She seemed&mdash;she had always seemed&mdash;more delicately feminine in
      Western costume. She was more slender now; her face a perfect oval under
      the smooth, deep-shadowed hair. Her dark eyes, deep with stoically
      controlled feeling, rested on this or that speaker. Doane found them once
      or twice resting thoughtfully on himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner Mrs. Withery, with a glance at her husband, laid a
      sympathetic hand on Hui's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said, all friendly sympathy, &ldquo;Mr. Doane's time is precious,
      these days and nights. I know that you should take this opportunity to
      talk over your problems with him. I shall be bustling about here&mdash;suppose
      you take him out into the courtyard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without a word they walked out there; stood by a gnarled tree whose
      twisted limbs extended over the low tiled roofs. There was a little light
      from the windows. The long silence that followed was the most difficult
      moment yet. Doane found himself breathing rather hard. In Hui Fei he felt
      the calm Oriental patience that underlay all her Western experiences. She
      simply waited for him to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked down at her, quite holding his breath. She seemed almost frail
      out here, in the half light. He was fighting, with all his strength and
      experience, the warm sweet feelings that drugged his brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear&mdash;&rdquo; he began; then, when she looked frankly up at him,
      hesitated. He hadn't known he was going to begin with any such phrase as
      that. He got on with it...."I'm wondering how I can best help you. If I
      were a younger man there would be no question as to what I would have to
      say to you.&rdquo; Utterly clumsy, of course; with little light ahead; just a
      dogged determination to serve her without hurting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think a good 'eal of wha' they tell me you're doing&rdquo;&mdash;thus Hui
      Fei, in a low but clear voice; not looking up now. &ldquo;I've almos' envied
      you. Helping li' that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be hard for you&mdash;with all your mental interests&mdash;to sit
      quietly here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My min' goes on, of course,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Yes, it isn' ver' easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was getting them nowhere. Doane, after a deep breath, took command of
      the situation. Sooner or later he would have to do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hui, dear,&rdquo; he said now&mdash;very quietly, but directly, &ldquo;this is a
      difficult situation for both of us. The only thing, of course, is to meet
      it as frankly as we can. I learned to love your father&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced up at this; her eyes glistened as the light caught them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;but we can not blindly follow his wishes. He had seen and felt the
      West, but he died a Manchu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her soft lips framed the one word, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; The softness of her whole face,
      indeed, was disconcerting; it was all sober emotion, that she plainly
      didn't think of trying to hide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'm sure you'll understand me when I tell you that I can not accept
      his legacy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She startled him now with the low but direct question: &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear....&rdquo; He found difficulty in going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don' know what I ought 'o say.&rdquo; He barely heard this; stopped a little.
      &ldquo;I don' know wha' to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you, dear&mdash;isn't there some clear vision in your heart&mdash;don't
      you see your way ahead? Remember, you will always have me to help&mdash;if
      I can help. It will mean everything to me to be your dearest friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want 'o work with you,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't dared believe that possible,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wan' me to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But it has to be clearer than that.&rdquo; He was stupid again; he sensed
      it himself. &ldquo;There is so much of life ahead of you. It's got to be clear
      that wherever your heart may lead you, child&mdash;that you shall have my
      steady friendship. The rest of it can grow as it may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wan'....&rdquo; He couldn't make out the words; he bent down close to her
      lovely face. &ldquo;I want 'o marry you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They both stood breathless then. Timidly her hand crept into his and
      nestled there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tha's the trouble&rdquo;&mdash;her voice was a very little stronger&mdash;&ldquo;there
      isn' anything else. It's ever'thing you think an' do&mdash;ever'thing you
      believe. We're both between the worl's, so....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The noise in his brain was like the pealing of cathedral bells at
      Christmas time. Yet in this rush of ecstatic feeling he suddenly saw
      clearly. The fabric of their companionship had hardly begun weaving. All
      his experience, his delicacy, his fine human skill, must be employed here.
      Ahead lay happiness! It was still nearly incredible.... And there lay&mdash;extending
      before them in a long vista&mdash;their intense common interest. The thing
      was to make a fine success of it. Build through the years.
    </p>
    <p>
      And happiness was greatly important. He had so nearly missed it....
      Looking up through the branches of the old tree, he smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he led her into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you had your talk already?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Withery pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've settled everything,&rdquo; said Doane. &ldquo;We're going to be married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very soon,&rdquo; said Hui Fei.
    </p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the
Foundation&rdquo; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; appears, or with which the
phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &ldquo;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
